A Vermont sheriff arrested Tuesday by the state police on multiple charges related to sexual and domestic assault pleaded not guilty and was then expected to be released on unsecured $100,000 bail.Peter Newton, 50, of Middlebury entered the pleas during an afternoon court appearance in Burlington, outside Addison County where the sheriff was arrested Tuesday while he was conducting contractor work at a construction job site in his hometown.During the arraignment Newton was served with what in Vermont is called an extreme risk protection order — known more generically in other states as a red flag law — that prevents him from possessing firearms.During the 35-minute hearing the defense attorney, prosecutor and judge focused on the appropriate conditions of release for Newton, a lifelong Vermonter with no criminal history.Defense attorney Jason Sawyer said Newton has not been convicted of a crime and he should be able to continue his work as sheriff “without engaging in law enforcement activities.”ADVERTISEMENTVermont Superior Court Judge John Pacht said Newton could not buy, use or have any firearms or dangerous weapons “with the exception that he can be at his place of employment as long as he does not possess or have immediate access to any firearms.”The state police investigation began March 3 when detectives were assigned to follow up on a report of a domestic disturbance involving Newton and a person with whom he was in a relationship that allegedly took place in Newton’s Middlebury home on Feb. 26. To avoid conflicts of interest, the case was investigated by troopers from the St. Albans barracks and it is being prosecuted by the office of the Washington County State’s Attorney.Prior to his arrest Newton, a nearly 20-year law enforcement veteran who was first elected sheriff in 2018, had already announced that he would not seek re-election this fall.
