LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — Plenette Pierson is returning to Texas Tech to be an assistant coach at her alma mater after spending most of the past 20 years in the WNBA, where she played on three championship teams.Texas Tech said Monday that Pierson, an assistant for the Minnesota Lynx for three years, will join coach Krista Gerlich’s staff in time for summer workouts in Lubbock.“She is one of the greatest players to come through the Lady Raider program and she has a significant toughness about her that I thoroughly enjoyed watching when she played,” Gerlich said. “What she’s done at the professional level the last 20 years has been remarkable. She will add a lot of credibility to our program and staff due to her knowledge and experience in the professional game.”Pierson graduated from Texas Tech in 2003, after four consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances that included two Elite Eight appearances and two other Sweet 16s. She was the fourth overall pick by Phoenix in the 2003 WNBA draft and went on to play 15 seasons with the Mercury, Detroit Shock/Tulsa Shock, New York Liberty and Dallas Wings. She was part of WNBA titles with the Shock in 2006 and 2008 and the Lynx during her final year as a player in 2017.Women's basketballWake Forest hires Gebbia as women's basketball coachWashington looking to build off Stringer success at RutgersCoquese Washington to succeed Stringer as Rutgers coachNC State women adding South Carolina transfer Saniya RiversADVERTISEMENTThe Lady Raiders were 102-30 overall during Pierson’s four seasons as a player.
