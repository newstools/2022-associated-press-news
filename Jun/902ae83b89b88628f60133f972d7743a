LIMESTONE, Maine (AP) — The man who led the redevelopment of the former Brunswick Naval Air Station hopes to work some magic in northern Maine.Steve Levesque retired from his post in as executive director of Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority late last year.But retirement didn’t suit him.His consulting firm SHL Enterprise Solutions will lead the renovation of the former Loring Air Force Base, which has not been as successful in reinventing itself after closure.“I’ve always loved community and economic development,” Levesque told the Times Record. “It’s just my thing.”Brunswick Landing, as the former Navy base is now called, now has 150 businesses and 2,600 workers.“Brunswick was a good success because there was a lot of partnerships and a lot of people working together to make it work,” he said. “That same thing can happen at Loring.”
