LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) — France forward Christopher Nkunku extended his contract with Leipzig through 2026 on Thursday after a breakout season that attracted the attention of some of Europe’s biggest clubs.Leipzig technical director Christopher Vivell called Nkunku “one of the best players in the world” after the extension of his contract, which had two more years to go.The 24-year-old Nkunku won the German Cup with Leipzig last season and scored 20 league goals as he was named Bundesliga player of the season. He also made his debut for France in March and has played all of his country’s six games since then.“RB Leipzig have made a name for themselves on the international stage in recent years and have shown time and again that we can compete for titles,” Nkunku said in a statement. “We want to build on that going forward and go one step further.”Nkunku’s performances for Leipzig and France had led to speculation he could move to the Premier League or return to Paris Saint-Germain, where he came through the academy and played until his 2019 move to Leipzig.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
