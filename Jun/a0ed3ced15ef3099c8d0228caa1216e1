NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) — Ollie Pope’s second test century was soon followed by Joe Root’s 27th as England reached tea on 331-2 on Day 3 of the second test against New Zealand on Sunday, 222 runs behind the Black Caps’ first-innings total of 553.Promoted to No. 3 for this international summer, Pope reached three figures for the first time in a home test — and since his 135 not out against South Africa in January 2020 — and was immediately congratulated by Root, who raced 40 meters to be with his jubilant teammate.Root is more used to compiling centuries and he got his fourth in his last five test matches with an inside edge for four just before tea. It was his quickest century of his career so far — in just 116 balls — and surely one of his best, given the sublime stroke-play he produced at Trent Bridge.Pope walked off unbeaten on 142 and Root was 109 not out. They appear to have crushed the spirit of New Zealand’s bowlers, who at least have a new ball in their hands after tea.ADVERTISEMENTThe only wicket to fall on Sunday came in the first session and was that of opener Alex Lees, who reached his first test half-century before wafting at a loose delivery from Matt Henry and edging behind to Daryl Mitchell at slip for 67.CricketSouth Africa wins toss, opts to bowl in second T20 v IndiaMitchell hits 190, drops 2 catches as NZ controls 2nd testNZ captain Williamson out of 2nd test vs England with COVIDRashid Khan leads Afghanistan to clean sweep over ZimbabweMitchell, who made a career-best 190 in New Zealand’s innings, looked relieved as he clutched the ball having dropped Lees and Pope after tea on Saturday.Root, who was dropped on 35 by Tim Southee at second slip just before lunch, has repeatedly dipped into his playbook of cover drives on the way to his fourth test century at Trent Bridge.
