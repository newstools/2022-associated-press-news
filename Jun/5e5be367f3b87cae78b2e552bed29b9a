JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Natural Resources is resigning to spend more time with family, Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office said on Tuesday.Dunleavy had announced Corri Feige as his pick to lead the department shortly after his election in 2018. She has been in that role throughout his term.Dunleavy’s office said the governor accepted Feige’s resignation “regretfully.”An interim commissioner will be appointed by the end of the month, Dunleavy’s office said. Feige’s last day will be June 30.There have been other recent changes within Dunleavy’s Cabinet.Nancy Dahlstrom, who was commissioner of the Department of Corrections under Dunleavy, resigned from that post last month to run for lieutenant governor on a Republican ticket with Dunleavy, who is seeking reelection. Jen Winkelman was named acting commissioner. Michael Johnson recently said he is stepping down as commissioner of the state education department, a role he has held since 2016. Under state law, the state board of education appoints a commissioner, with that person subject to approval by the governor.Dunleavy had designated Johnson as the lieutenant governor successor, or the state department leader who would become lieutenant governor if that office became vacant. The administration has not announced a new designee for that role yet.
