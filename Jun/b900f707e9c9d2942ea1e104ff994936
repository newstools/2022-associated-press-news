SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Logan Webb pitched five-hit ball over seven scoreless innings to win for the first time in a month, and the San Francisco Giants stretched their winning streak to five with a 4-2 win over the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday night.Webb (6-2) struck out a season-high nine and walked three. He had been 0-1 in five starts since a May 13 win at St. Louis.“That’s what we expect,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. “That’s where he put the bar, and now we expect him to meet it.”Camilo Doval pitched the ninth for his ninth save in 11 chances. After a nine-pitch walk to Carlos Santana leading off, Doval retired Kyle Isbel on a lineout, then struck out Ryan O’Hearn and Nicky Lopez, topping 100 mph with seven of 22 pitches.The Giants have not allowed more than two runs in any game during their winning streak.“This something I know I talked a lot about last year,” Webb said. “We feed off of that.”ADVERTISEMENTKansas City has lost the first two games of the three-game series and 12 of 16 overall. At 20-41, the Royals have the worst record in the major leagues.Kris Bubic (0-4) remained winless in eight starts this season, though he lowered his ERA from 9.13 to 8.36. “You feed off your confidence, especially early on,” Bubic said. “Once you get into a good rhythm early on, then you just try to keep that as consistent as you can.”MLBGonsolin earns 8th victory, Dodgers edge Angels 2-0LEADING OFF: Braves go for 14th straight, Flaherty returnsReds try to extend road win streak in matchup against the DiamondbacksMariners and Twins meet with series tied 1-1Bubic gave up three runs, five hits and two walks in 5 1/3 innings.“Some of the best stuff we’ve seen from him, the whole mix,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “One of the best fastballs we’ve seen from him all year, not just velocity-wise but location. Curveball was sharp, getting the swing and miss.”San Francisco took a 3-0 lead in the sixth. Luis González doubled and scored on Wilmer Flores’ single.
