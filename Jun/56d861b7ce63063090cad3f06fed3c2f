NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets appeared to be headed for gains Thursday with European Central Bank announcing its first interest rate hike in 11 years.The bank will make two quarter-point increases, with the second arriving in September. The surprise decision is in reaction to inflation that has become a “major challenge,” with the central bank believing that forces pushing costs higher had “broadened and intensified.” Futures for the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 rose more than 0.3%. European shares declined in early trading as France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.5% in midday trading while Germany’s DAX dropped 0.9%. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.7%.

That would be the second straight increase of double the usual amount by the U.S. central bank, and investors expect a third in July.ADVERTISEMENTThe big concern on Wall Street remains whether the Fed’s shift to aggressively raising interest rates will help temper the impact or possibly push the economy into a recession.PoliticsJan. 6 Capitol attack committee goes prime time with probeChina and Russia defend North Korea vetoes in first at UNHearings guide: What to know as the Jan. 6 panel goes publicWhat we know about Trump's actions as insurrection unfoldedThe Fed’s goal is to slow economic growth enough to cushion inflation’s impact. Demand for goods had been outpacing supplies and production capacity through most of the post-pandemic recovery.
