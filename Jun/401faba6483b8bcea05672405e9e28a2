French senators demanded Thursday that the state recognize responsibility and identify guilty parties behind the chaos outside the national stadium that marred the Champions League final last month.They also questioned why surveillance video of the scene — in which police pepper-sprayed fans and families — was automatically deleted, and why government officials didn’t order it handed over to investigators instead. The fiasco drew worldwide attention to heavy-handed French policing and raised questions about how France manages security at big events.“The general impression of the unfolding of the Champions League’s final is a lack of preparation, upstream lack of preparedness, lack of responsiveness during the events and questionable management after the events,” Senator Laurent Lafon, leading a commission seeking explanations for what happened, said Thursday.“The gravity of the events ... requires a response from the state,” he said. He did not name any specific culprits but noted that all those responsible for managing the situation “at some point or another failed,” and that all of them worked for the government.ADVERTISEMENTThe automatic deletion of the surveillance video leads to “an impression that there is no one responsible, and since there is no one responsible, there is no one who is guilty,” he said.SoccerEuropean leagues urge fairer share of rising UEFA prize cashRussian basketball teams suspended from EuroLeague seasonThe 23 venues bidding to host World Cup matches in 2026AP SportlightHe and another senator spoke at the Stade de France to sum up the commission’s work so far.
