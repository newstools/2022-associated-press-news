We absorbed the pressure in these last two games and it is good to see this series go down to the final match.” Chasing 170, South Africa was down to 26-2 in 5.2 overs. Quinton de Kock was run out for 14, and Dwaine Pretorious was caught behind off Khan for a six-ball duck.Effectively, the chasing side was three down when skipper Temba Bavuma retired hurt on 8 after Khan’s bouncer injured his left elbow.ADVERTISEMENTRassie van der Dussen scored 20 off 20 balls for South Africa’s top score.
