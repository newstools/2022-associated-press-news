ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The parents of three children injured in a crash involving an Albuquerque Public Schools bus four months ago have filed a lawsuit against the driver of the speeding car involved and his insurance company.The Albuquerque Journal reported Sunday that the 2nd Judicial District Court suit was filed on behalf of parents of two girls and a boy – identified only by their initials – who were passengers on the school bus.The Feb. 23 crash sent five people to the hospital, including several middle school students.Two students suffered serious injuries including a broken pelvis and a broken femur that required surgery.The 50-year-old driver of the car involved in the crash allegedly was racing another vehicle at more than 100 mph in a 40 mph zone at the time of the bus collision and facing a criminal trial. According to the Journal, the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for medical expenses and “future physical and emotional pain and suffering.”The school bus driver has not been cited in the crash, but the suit alleges that “APS breached its duties of care by failing to exercise reasonable care while operating its vehicle.”
