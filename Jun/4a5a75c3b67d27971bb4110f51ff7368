LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky’s most populated county has received nearly $360,000 in awards to enhance accessibility and improve three parks, Gov. Andy Beshear said.The funding is for projects at Jefferson Memorial Forest in Fairdale, Little Hunting Creek Park in Prospect and Wetherby Park in Middletown — all in Jefferson County.The funding comes from the Land & Water Conservation Fund. To receive the federal funds, which are administered at the state level by the Department for Local Government, selected applicants must undergo federal review and receive approval from the National Park Service.Beshear on Tuesday presented a $200,000 grant for improvements to the Tom Wallace Recreation Area at Jefferson Memorial Forest. The funds will go toward construction of a paved path. The new path will allow visitors to travel from the front of the park to the back of the park around the lake. The path will be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
