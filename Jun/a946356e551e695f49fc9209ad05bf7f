TYLOSAND, Sweden (AP) — Swedish golfer Linn Grant was flying the flag for the women at the Scandinavian Mixed event after producing a bogey-free 6-under 66 on Saturday to take a two-stroke lead into the final round.After three rounds of a tournament that sees men and women play on the same course for one prize fund and one trophy, Grant is the only female player in the top 16 at Halmstad Golf Club.And among her closest challengers is Henrik Stenson, one of Sweden’s greatest ever golfers who is three shots back and will be attempting to hunt down Grant on Sunday.“That will be shaky, I guess,” Grant said with a smile. “I am here to do my golf and I hope it takes me all the way -- and if it does, I’ll take it for the women.”A birdie from four feet on the 18th after another superb approach wrapped up a flawless round by Grant that contained an eagle at No. 11 from off the green. The putt was measured by the European tour at 25 yards.ADVERTISEMENTStarting Saturday in a tie for second place and two shots behind Jason Scrivener, the 22-year-old Grant is now two clear of the Australian on 16 under overall and the two will play in the final group Sunday.Grant is playing her first full year as a professional and has already won two events on the Ladies European Tour, most recently in Belgium last month.GolfAvery wins 2 matches, US takes 5-point lead in Curtis CupFrida Kinhult takes 1-shot lead into ShopRite LPGA finaleFinau shoots 62, shares RBC Canadian Open lead with McIlroy$4.75M: Schwartzel wins richest golf event amid Saudi outcry“I hope that people realize that we are actually getting there, getting close to the guys and having the same journey as the men have had the last 35-40 years,” she said.Her aim going into Sunday, Grant added, was “to really put women’s golf more on the map than it is at the moment.”Stenson made what he called a “blistering” start with five birdies in his first eight holes, but bogeyed both of the par fives on the back nine to set him back.His round of 67 left him in third place, three strokes behind Grant. Only one other player, Sebastian Garcia Rodriguez, who is 12 under overall after a 67, is within five shots of Grant.___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
