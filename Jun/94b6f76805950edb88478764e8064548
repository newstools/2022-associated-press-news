His court-appointed federal public defender entered a not guilty plea to the single federal charge on his behalf.Riess is accused of sending multiple emails May 15 to the FBI’s website threatening to “shoot up’′ Middleton Elementary School because of the agency’s failure to stop “hackers,” according to a federal affidavit and Sherwood police.The FBI had received earlier emails from Riess, but those didn’t name a specific target or school, the affidavit said, though they did threaten that Riess would walk into a school and kill innocent children. He sent those emails between May 5 and May 13, according the affidavit.FBI agents arrested Riess at his Tigard apartment on May 16.He has pleaded not guilty to six counts of first-degree disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, in Washington County Circuit Court.
