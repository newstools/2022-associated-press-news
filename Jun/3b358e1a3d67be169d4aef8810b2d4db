MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Mexican government said Tuesday it has agreed to review a labor complaint filed by the United States under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade pact. The complaint filed earlier this month said workers’ rights to freely choose their union may have been violated at a Panasonic Automotive Systems factory in Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas.Mexico’s Economy Department said in a statement it would meet with the parties in the dispute to determine if there were any violations of labor codes. Activists say that even though employees at the plant voted in April to join an independent union, the company continues to work with the old union.All three of the U.S. labor complaints filed against Mexico so far under the trade pact involve Mexican workers’ efforts to replace old-guard unions that have long signed contracts behind workers’ backs and kept wages low.In April, workers at the Panasonic Automotive Systems factory voted overwhelmingly to be represented by a new union.

Workers at a GM plant in the northern Mexico city of Silao voted to oust the old-guard Confederation of Mexican Workers and replace it with an independent union. Such votes, while still scattered and few in number, could eventually stem the outflow of U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico, as it becomes harder for employers to guarantee low wages by signing contracts with the old-guard Mexican unions. Many Mexican workers make 10% to 15% of wages for similar jobs in the U.S.
