He reached the fourth round in 2018 for his career-best result at the All England Club.ADVERTISEMENTTsitsipas, who lost last year’s French Open final to Novak Djokovic, will next face Kyrgios in a matchup of hard hitters.“It’s going to be a challenging one on grass for sure,” Tsitsipas said about facing Kyrgios. “He’s a big opponent for this surface.”___2:20 p.m.Nick Kyrgios reached the third round at Wimbledon with a performance that made sure his tennis was the only talking point this time.Kyrgios beat 26th-seeded Filip Krajinovic 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 on No. 2 Court, showing off an array of shot-making that included 50 winners, 24 aces and a couple of crowd-pleasing “tweeners.”Kyrgios never faced a break point and looked fully focused throughout the match, without getting into any major arguments with the chair umpire or the crowd — although he did berate one fan for coughing during the second set.After needing five sets to beat Paul Jubb in the first round, the volatile Australian spit in the direction of a spectator he said had been hassling him.Kyrgios said his first-round match had been surprisingly difficult and that this time “I just wanted to remind everyone that I’m pretty good.”___1 p.m.Roberto Bautista Agut has withdrawn from Wimbledon after testing positive for COVID-19.ADVERTISEMENTThe 17th-seeded Spaniard was scheduled to play Daniel Elahi Galan of Colombia in the second round at the All England Club.“I was positive for COVID-19.
