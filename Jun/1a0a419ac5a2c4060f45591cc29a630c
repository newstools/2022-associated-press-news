But Circuit Judge Kathleen M. Dailey said James fired at the vehicle as it drove away, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.“Even if what you were saying was true, at some time, in that whole thing it stopped being true,” she said. “You can’t be shooting at an exiting vehicle and keep shooting, shooting, shooting and expect that to be self-defense.”Markell Devon Jones, 44, was shot in the head, chest, right arm and neck. He died shortly after at a hospital. The vehicle driver was hit in the right upper arm, and a young woman two blocks away was hit in the neck with a bullet fragment.
