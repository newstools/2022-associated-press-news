MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Erling Haaland has come home.The Norway striker finalized his move to Manchester City from Borussia Dortmund for 60 million euros ($63 million) on Monday to seal his return to England, the country of his birth.His father, Alf-Inge, played for City in the Premier League from 2000-03 and Erling supported the club as a kid. He has posted on social media pictures of himself wearing a City jersey as a young boy.“This is a proud day for me and my family. I have always watched City and have loved doing so in recent seasons,” Haaland said. “You can’t help but admire their style of play — it’s exciting — and they create a lot of chances, which is perfect for a player like me.”Haaland, regarded as one of the world’s top young players along with Kylian Mbappe, is joining on a five-year deal. City activated the release clause in Haaland’s Dortmund contract and looks to be getting a superstar on the cheap.ADVERTISEMENT“We have been monitoring Erling for several years now, so we are delighted to bring him here to Manchester City,” said Txiki Begiristain, the club’s director of football.“He is a huge talent and has been one of the best strikers in Europe over the last few seasons. His goalscoring record is exceptional and his performances at Borussia Dortmund and in the Champions League in particular have proved he can succeed at the highest level. Erling has everything we want in a striker, and we are certain he will excel in this squad and this system.”SoccerBenfica, Liverpool agree on Darwin Núñez transferSeattle Sounders host the Vancouver Whitecaps in conference actionPeru, Australia ready to playoff for a World Cup spotBoateng lifts Revolution to 2-1 victory over Sporting KCHaaland has scored 20 goals in 21 appearances for Norway and netted 86 goals in 89 games in two and a half seasons with Dortmund.
