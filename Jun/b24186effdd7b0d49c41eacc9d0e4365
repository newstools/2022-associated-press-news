In the Guangxi autonomous region, 145,000 people were relocated to safety and more than 10,000 houses were destroyed, the official Xinhua New Agency reported.Another half million people were affected in neighboring Jiangxi province, where 433,000 hectares (1 million acres) of crops were flooded, according to local authorities. Around 274,000 people have sought relief in Guangzhou province, according to the provincial emergency management department. The heavy rainfall has collapsed roads in some parts of cities and swept away houses, cars and crops. The meteorological department has forecast more rain in coming days. Chinese authorities on Sunday issued the year’s first red alert, the most severe warning, for possible mountain torrents.ADVERTISEMENTChina regularly experiences flooding during the summer months, most frequently in central and southern areas that tend to receive the most rainfall.
