BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Construction is scheduled to begin this week on a long-planned road project in the south end of Burlington, Mayor Miro Weinberger said.The comments came after a federal judge lifted an order that blocked work on the first phase of what is known as the Champlain Parkway.The first phase of construction will include tree removal and work to protect a brook running through the area. Opponents say the project does not match current transportation needs and will harm residents in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods. In the Friday order, U.S. District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford said beginning construction of the parkway would not cause irreparable harm to those who oppose the project and there will be time to address in court those underlying issues. The Champlain Parkway is designed to be a two-lane road that will eventually connect Interstate 189 with downtown Burlington.The $45 million, two-mile (three-kilometer) project is designed to improve traffic circulation, alleviate overburdened roadways, protect Lake Champlain through enhanced storm water management, and improve vehicular, bike, and pedestrian safety.
