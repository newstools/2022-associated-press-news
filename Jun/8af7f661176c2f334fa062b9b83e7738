Just before 9:40 p.m., she got a cigarette lighter from a display near a register. She then set the fire in an area containing ladies’ fashion accessories, the news release said.The sheriff’s office, which is working with the parish fire department and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said it does not expect criminal charges because of the child’s age.

No injuries were reported.
