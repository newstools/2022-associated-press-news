ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Corey Kluber excelled again at Globe Life Field, pitching six solid innings as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Texas Rangers 3-1 on Thursday.In his previous appearance at the ballpark, Kluber threw a no-hitter at Texas on May 19, 2021, while with the New York Yankees.In his only other game at Globe Life Field, which opened in July 2020 during the pandemic-delayed season, he left after one inning and 18 pitches in his only start as a member of the Rangers. He tore a muscle in his pitching shoulder and was lost for the rest of that year.Kluber allowed one run and four hits, striking out four and walking none. The two-time AL Cy Young Award winner matched his longest outing of the season.Vidal Brujan hit an RBI double in the second inning and Yandy Diaz singled home in the third for Tampa Bay.The Rays won the last two games of the four-game road series to earn a split, repeating what they did at Yankee Stadium in their previous series, and are back to a season-best nine games over .500.ADVERTISEMENTThe Rangers have lost two straight after reaching .500 for the first time since May 2021.The lone run off Kluber (2-2) was a two-out, first-pitch home run by Marcus Semien that was pulled down the left-field line in the sixth.MLBDaz Cameron's HR in 8th lifts surging Tigers past Twins 3-2This Date in BaseballThis Date in BaseballThis Date in BaseballRyan Thompson, the fifth Rays reliever, pitched a perfect ninth for his third save in six chances this season.Diaz, Manuel Margot and Harold Ramirez each had two hits for the Rays.
