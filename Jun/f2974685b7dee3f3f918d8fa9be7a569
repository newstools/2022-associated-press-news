LONDON (AP) — Kevin Spacey “strenuously denies” allegations of sexual assault, his lawyer said Thursday, as the Oscar-winning actor appeared in a London court to face five charges of offenses against three men.Photographers and television camera crews thronged Spacey, 62, as he arrived at London’s Westminster Magistrates Court for the preliminary hearing, walking into court accompanied by members of his legal team and two police officers.Spacey sat in the glass-fronted dock during the half-hour hearing, standing to give his full name — Kevin Spacey Fowler — as well as his birthdate and a London address.He was not asked to enter a formal plea, but his lawyer, Patrick Gibbs, said: “Mr. Spacey strenuously denies any and all criminality in this case.”“He has returned to the U.K. in order to establish his innocence,” Gibbs said. “He needs to answer these charges if he is to proceed with his life.”ADVERTISEMENTDeputy Chief Magistrate Tan Ikram granted Spacey unconditional bail until his next appearance, a plea hearing scheduled for July 14 at London’s Southwark Crown Court. He is free to return to the U.S. in the meantime.The former “House of Cards” star is accused of four counts of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.EntertainmentBeyoncé announces new album 'Renaissance' to drop July 29Nipsey Hussle's last moments detailed as murder trial opensMo'Nique, Netflix reportedly settle her suit alleging biasRussian sanctions hurting small Italian fashion producersThe alleged incidents took place in London between March 2005 and August 2008, and one in western England in April 2013.
