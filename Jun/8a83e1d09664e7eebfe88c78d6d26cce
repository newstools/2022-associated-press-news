ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s foreign ministry on Friday said authorities were trying to trace and arrest suspects who this week desecrated a Hindu temple located at a home in the country’s port city of Karachi, drawing condemnation from India.In a statement, the ministry said that investigations were still underway, and that those who attacked the temple Wednesday before fleeing the scene “will not escape justice and the government will deal with them with the full force of law.”The statement came a day after New Delhi condemned the incident. Arindam Bagchi, spokesperson at India’s External Affairs Ministry, expressed concern on Thursday over the vandalization of the temple, saying it was “another act in the systematic persecution of religious minorities” in Pakistan.However, Pakistan’s foreign ministry rejected Bagchi’s allegation of systematic persecution, instead saying such violence was taking place against minority Muslims in India.ADVERTISEMENTAnger has been growing in Pakistan against India since last week when two spokespeople for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party made comments seen as insulting to Islam’s prophet and his wife Aisha. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party suspended one official and expelled the other, saying it rejects the insulting of religious figures.PoliticsCapitol riot panel blames Trump for 1/6  'attempted coup'Capitol officer recounts Jan. 6 'war scene' in her testimonyTakeaways: 'Carnage' at the Capitol and a case against TrumpUS lifts COVID-19 test requirement for international travelOn Friday, thousands of Islamists protested the comments in Lahore and Karachi.
