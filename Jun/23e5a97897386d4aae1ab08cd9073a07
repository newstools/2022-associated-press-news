HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaiian Airlines and Par Hawaii, the state’s largest supplier of energy products, said Wednesday they will join forces to study the commercial viability of locally produced, sustainable aviation fuel. The two companies said in a statement they are aiming for the fuel to replace all or a percentage of the kerosene-based jet fuel that Hawaiian currently uses. The companies said they signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly evaluate the potential of converting two processing units at Par’s Kapolei refinery to produce renewable fuels. They plan to explore producing locally-grown, oil-yielding crops and study the feasibility of importing raw material to produce sustainable aviation fuel.“This is a major step for both organizations to reduce carbon emissions, to address climate change and to create a more sustainable energy future for Hawaii,” the companies said.Scott Glenn, the state’s chief energy officer, said in a statement that transportation accounts for more than half of Hawaii’s greenhouse gas emissions. He said transportation emissions were the state’s biggest challenge when it comes to fighting climate change. Glenn said the two companies have a “tremendous opportunity” to contribute to Hawaii’s clean energy goals. Par Hawaii, LLC is an affiliate of Par Pacific Holdings, Inc.
