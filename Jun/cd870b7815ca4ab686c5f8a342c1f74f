BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The drought that a year ago had enveloped all of North Dakota has dissipated, according to this week’s monitoring report. The U.S. Drought Monitor map shows no areas of the state are in any drought categories. The entire state experienced some level of drought a year ago, with two-thirds of North Dakota in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. “Much of the northern tier states experienced beneficial rainfall and near- to below-normal temperatures (over the week), predominantly leading to drought improvements from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Plains,” National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Meteorologist Adam Hartman wrote in Thursday’s report.“Much of the High Plains region has seen beneficial rainfall and temperatures averaging near- to below-normal over the past 30 days,” he added.One month ago, the western part of the state was still in drought, the Bismarck Tribune reported. ADVERTISEMENTSpring planting is a bit behind because of overly wet conditions lately. Some farmers are still working to get their crops in the field, which is later than normal.The most recent crop report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service shows 91% of the state’s staple spring wheat crop is planted, up from 74% last week. Most other major crops are more than 80% planted, with several of them beyond the 90% mark. Sunflowers are at 70% and soybeans at 75%.Topsoil moisture supplies statewide are 94% adequate or surplus, and subsoil moisture is 93% in those categories.
