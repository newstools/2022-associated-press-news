Fainga’anuku has been preferred on the left wing ahead of Blues winger Caleb Clarke who recently has been sidelined with a hamstring injury.Head coach Ian Foster, who also is isolating after contracting COVID, has named Rieko Ioane and Quinn Tupaea in midfield, favoring that combination after centers David Havili and Jack Goodhue both tested positive.ADVERTISEMENTBeauden Barrett has been named ahead of Richie Mo’unga at flyhalf, though Mo’unga had the upper hand when the two met for the Crusaders and Blues respectively in the Super Rugby final.RugbyUK sports minister confuses rugby league with rugby union'Vintage' Wallaby to make debut against England at 33New Zealand Maori beat Ireland 32-17 in 1st tour matchSpringboks select Jantjies at 10, Willemse at 15 for WalesScott Barrett, who captained the Crusaders this season from lock, will start on the blindside flank as the All Blacks anticipate a physical contest with Ireland’s large forward pack.

We have huge respect for this Irish team and can’t wait to run out onto a packed Eden Park on Saturday.” For Ireland, Robbie Henshaw and Garry Ringrose will form in an experienced midfield partnership while another New Zealand-born player, James Lowe, will start his 13th test on the left wing.Prop Andrew Porter returns to the starting lineup after missing Ireland’s last two matches in the Six Nations championship with injury.
