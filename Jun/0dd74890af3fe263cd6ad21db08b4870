JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Authorities on the southern tip of Indonesia’s Sumatra island arrested a Japanese fugitive accused of fraud in Japan in connection with the receipt of a massive amount of COVID-19 subsidies for small businesses in distress, police said Wednesday.Mitsuhiro Taniguchi, 47, was arrested late night Tuesday in Kalirejo village of Central Lampung district, by immigration officers and backed by local police, said National Police spokesperson Dedi Prasetyo. Taniguchi was wanted by Japanese police over pandemic subsidy fraud and left Japan for Indonesia in October 2020, Prasetyo said. Taniguchi and a group of acquaintances allegedly submitted some 1,700 false applications for COVID-19 relief funds. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department believes they received subsidies in more than 960 of those applications for an estimated 960 million yen ($7.3 million).He said there was no red notice related to Taniguchi’s case, but Indonesian police have taken proactive steps by coordinating with immigration to detect his presence since entering Indonesian territory.ADVERTISEMENT“His presence in Indonesia became illegal after the Japanese authorities revoked his passport,” Prasetyo said, adding that Taniguchi has been handed over to the Directorate of Immigration’s Supervision and Enforcement division and authorities are coordinating with Japanese diplomats for a deportation process.COVID-19Migration gets top billing as Biden hosts hemisphere leadersJapan's economy contracts, but at smaller rate than thoughtNext UN assembly president warns world in dangerous crisisRare normalcy returns to trial of Florida school shooterTokyo police arrested Taniguchi’s ex-wife and their two sons May 30 on suspicion of fraud and Tokyo’s MPD placed him on an international wanted list, according to Japanese newspaper The Mainichi Shimbun.
