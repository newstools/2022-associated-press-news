On June 2, 1941, Gehrig died of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, now known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.ADVERTISEMENTThe Hall of Famer’s life and accomplishments on and off the field will be remembered with tributes and ceremonies across the majors, along with messages and information about efforts to treat and research ALS.MLBRiley homers, Wright throws 6 scoreless in Atlanta's 6-0 winAngels-Yankees game rained out, split doubleheader ThursdayVerlander nears another no-hitter, Astros rally past A's 5-4Red Sox place RHP Barnes on 15-day IL with shoulder issuePlayers, managers and coaches will wear a Lou Gehrig Day patch and there will be ALS-4 logos at the ballparks to celebrate his uniform number.

He quickly put himself in trouble by walking the bases loaded with no outs and Yankees stars Giancarlo Stanton and Gleyber Torres followed with RBI hits.A big crowd that turned out to see the eventual AL MVP instead watched him walk off the mound and out of the game in the bottom of the first inning.Ohtani (3-3, 3.45 ERA) has struck out 63 in 44 1/3 innings over eight starts this season.INJURY TO INSULTAs if things weren’t dire enough for the Phillies, star Bryce Harper was scratched from the lineup Wednesday with right forearm soreness, and second baseman Jean Segura could miss three months with a fractured right index finger.Philadelphia entered Wednesday 12 1/2 games behind the Mets in the NL East, with manager Joe Girardi’s seat getting hotter by the day. It’s not clear how long they’ll be without Harper, who has been the team’s designated hitter after being diagnosed with a small UCL tear in his right elbow. He hurt it on a throw from right field and hasn’t played defense since April 16.Segura will be out 10 to 12 weeks after injuring himself while attempting to bunt in the seventh inning of Tuesday’s 7-4 11-inning loss to the Giants. He will have surgery as early as Friday.The Phillies have a day off before opening a series against Mike Trout and the Angels on Friday.ADVERTISEMENTNO-GO ON TRADING SOTOThe last-place Nationals have no plans to trade star outfielder Juan Soto, according to Washington president of baseball operations and general manager Mike Rizzo Rizzo told The Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday that Washington plans to build around the 23-year-old slugger, who can become a free agent following the 2024 season.
