He’s due in court for arraignment on Thursday.Dyker, 52, who had been on desk duty since shortly after the incident last summer, resigned from the Chicago Police Department in May before any formal disciplinary action was announced against him, a department spokesperson said last week. He had been a Chicago officer since 1998.Videos showing Dyker grabbing Nikkita Brown shortly after midnight on Aug. 28, 2021, as she walked her French bulldog at North Avenue Beach later went viral.In one video recorded by a bystander, Brown and her dog appear to be walking away from the officer as he follows closely.ADVERTISEMENTBrown repeatedly tells Dyker not to come closer and to back up because he isn’t wearing a face mask. But he continues to approach and order her to leave the area because it was closed.Moments later, the officer appears to reach for Brown’s phone and then grabs her as she can be heard yelling, “Let go!” and struggles to break free.PoliticsBiden tells oil refiners: Produce more gas, fewer profitsLaxalt's Nevada win sets up fierce race for Senate controlRice loses House seat after impeaching Trump; Mace holds onElection 2022 Takeaways: Big Trump win, Nev.
