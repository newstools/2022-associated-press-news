BOSTON (AP) — A digital attack on a Massachusetts-based health care organization may have compromised the personal information of as many as 2 million people, officials said.Shields Health Care Group Inc., which provides imaging and ambulatory surgical services at dozens of locations, said in a notice on its website Tuesday that data including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and medical or treatment details is among the information that may have been compromised.The breach has been reported to federal law enforcement and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. That agency reported on its website that 2 million people were affected. An FBI spokesperson said the agency had no comment.Shields said it “was alerted to suspicious activity that may have involved data compromise” on March 28 and immediately started investigating.“This investigation determined that an unknown actor gained access to certain Shields systems from March 7, 2022 to March 21, 2022,” the company said. “Furthermore, the investigation revealed that certain data was acquired by the unknown actor within that time frame.”ADVERTISEMENTThere is no evidence to indicate that any of the compromised information has been been used to commit identity theft or fraud, Shields said in a statement Wednesday.TechnologyEU lawmakers endorse ban on combustion-engine cars in 2035Reports: Twitter to provide Musk with raw daily tweet dataCrypto meltdown is wake-up call for many, including CongressOne plug and done: EU to require common way to charge phones“Shields takes the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care seriously,” the website notice said. “Upon discovery, we took steps to secure our systems, including rebuilding certain systems, and conducted a thorough investigation to confirm the nature and scope of the activity and to determine who may be affected.”The company’s review continues, and once it is complete, people directly affected will be notified, officials said.Quincy-based Shields has about 40 locations, mostly in Massachusetts but also in New Hampshire and Maine.
