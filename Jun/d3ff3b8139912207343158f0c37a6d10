AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — A candidate in a runoff for mayor of Georgia’s third-largest city is announcing a plan to redevelop a site where a long-vacant mall stood until 2020. Steven Kendrick of Augusta made the announcement last week, with several Augusta commissioners.The redevelopment plan for the Regency Mall’s site would include 1,000 two-bedroom apartments, a K-12 school, a 300-seat performing arts center, a restaurant, a grocery store and a fitness center, news outlets report.“The growth and revitalization of South Augusta is just beginning,” Kendrick told local news outlets as he unveiled plans for what would be called Cardinal Town Square.Kendrick, the former Richmond County tax commissioner, is in a June 21 runoff with Garnett Johnson for mayor of the consolidated city-county. The third-place finisher endorsed Johnson last week. Kendrick and Johnson each received about 39% of the vote on May 24.ADVERTISEMENTAn architect who helped draw plans told WRDW-TV the redevelopment would cost $100 million to $175 million.What was once a major retail draw sat vacant for nearly two decades before demolition began in 2020.
