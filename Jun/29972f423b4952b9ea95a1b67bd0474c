HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) — A dominant first-half performance set the New Zealand Maori on course to a 32-17 win over the touring Ireland rugby team Wednesday in the first of two matches between the teams.The Maori scored four tries to one to lead 32-10 at halftime in a match played in wet and slippery conditions. Ireland improved its share of possession and scored the only try of the second half through backrower Gavin Coombes.New Zealand-born center Bundee Aki captained Ireland for the first time and scored their first-half try.Wednesday’s win added another entry to the Maori’s long list of international victories. The team composed of players of indigenous Maori heritage has previously beaten England, Scotland, Argentina, the British and Irish Lions and Ireland among others during the professional era.Ireland fielded a mainly second-string lineup in the match ahead of their clash with the All Blacks on Saturday in the first of three test matches. The tourists attempted to play the slow, patterned and controlling style of play that previously has been successful against New Zealand; they have won three of their last five tests against the All Blacks.ADVERTISEMENTBut the Maori won 70 percent of possession in the first half, helped by a heavy penalty count against Ireland. Fullback Zarn Sullivan had an outstanding match on his debut for the Maori and had a hand in several of their first half tries.RugbySpringboks select Jantjies at 10, Willemse at 15 for WalesAll Blacks COVID outbreak grows ahead of Ireland testSpain loses appeal, remains out of 2023 Rugby World CupNZ coaches, 2 players have COVID-19 before 1st Ireland test“We were encouraged if there was space in front of us to have a crack,” Maori captain Brad Weber said. “We were happy to have a crack from our own 22 if we saw that it was on.“We just wanted to play with a bit of flair and at a pace that Ireland couldn’t handle.”That tactic was the key to the Maori success. With such a large share of possession in the first half, they were able to dictate the pace of the game, taking that initiative from Ireland.Quick ruck ball and the ability to move the ball quickly into outside channels allowed the Maori to get around, through and behind Ireland’s flat, rush defense and put the tourists on the back foot for most of the first spell. Ireland addressed those problems at halftime and came out with more determination in the second half, holding the ball for longer periods and playing the game at a more comfortable pace.But for all their possession, they managed only one try from a tapped penalty close to the Maori line. After an initial surge, they won quick phase ball and the No. 8 Coombes was driven over.“The Maori boys came out firing and they were playing on top of us from the get go,” Aki said. “We couldn’t get our game going and they deserved their win.“We got a lot of learnings out of this game. There are a lot of new boys here, a lot of young guys and I’m sure we’ll learn a lot from this game and apply those lessons for the rest of the series.”Sullivan made his imprint on the game early with his sound defense of the high ball. In the 15th minute he won a 50-22, putting the ball in touch inside the Ireland 22 from his own half.ADVERTISEMENTFrom the lineout, the Maori attacked on the left and then the right and Sullivan dived over for the first try.Aki scored for Ireland in the 21st minute, running off a short pass from Coombes and sliding over under the posts.Flyhalf Josh Ioane broke out of defense and drew the last defender before passing to winger Shaun Stevenson who scored in the 29th minute.Scrumhalf Weber dashed over in the 35th minute with the defense stretched and backrower Cullen Grace finished a move just before halftime which began with Sullivan’s handling of a keep deep within his own half.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
