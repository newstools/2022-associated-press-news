TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gas prices have soared to record highs again in New Jersey and around the nation at large following the Memorial Day weekend.AAA Mid-Atlantic says the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.83, up eight cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.05 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline shot up to $4.76, up 17 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.04 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.Analysts say the pent-up urge for travel has so far outweighed the skyrocketing prices at the pump for many consumers, but two=thirds of drivers recently surveyed said they would change their driving habits if gas hit $4.50 a gallon and three-quarters said they would do so if it topped $5 a gallon.
