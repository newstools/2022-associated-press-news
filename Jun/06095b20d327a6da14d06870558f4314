LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Jessica Keller has been hired as an assistant coach at Nebraska after five seasons at Illinois State.Coach Amy Williams announced the addition of Keller on Monday, three weeks after Nebraska confirmed it had parted ways with associate head coach Chuck Love.“We are thrilled to add Jessica Keller to our Husker women’s basketball staff,” Williams said. “She is an outstanding basketball mind with great teaching skills and she has established herself as a person of high character and integrity. She is a tireless worker that fits perfectly with the culture here at Nebraska, and I am excited to have her pouring into the young women in our program.”Love was suspended with pay in February and sophomore guard Ashley Scoggin was removed from the team the same week. The Nebraska athletic department has not said if the Love and Scoggin situations were connected. Scoggin has since transferred to UNLV.ADVERTISEMENTNebraska was 24-9 last season and lost to Gonzaga in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.___More AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
