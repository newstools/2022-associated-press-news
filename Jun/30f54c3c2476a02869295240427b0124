CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Charlotte Hornets have agreed to terms on a contract with Golden State Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson to become their next head coach, according to a person familiar with the situation.The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Friday because Atkinson has not yet signed the contract. The Warriors play the Boston Celtics Friday night in Game 4 of the NBA Finals.The 55-year-old Atkinson was 118-190 in three-plus seasons as head coach of the Brooklyn Nets as the organization was undergoing a rebuilding process.He is the second Golden State assistant to accept a new job during the Warriors’ playoff run this spring. Warriors assistant Mike Brown has taken the job as Sacramento’s new coach, though is remaining with Golden State through the end of the NBA Finals.Atkinson’s hiring by the Hornets leaves only one current opening in the NBA -- that being Utah, after Quin Snyder made the decision to step down earlier this week.ADVERTISEMENTAtkinson inherits a team that hasn’t been to the playoffs since the 2015-16 season and hasn’t won a playoff series in more than two decades.Still, there is talent on the roster to build around.All-Star point guard LaMelo Ball is considered to be the player the franchise is building around, and guard Terry Rozier, much-improved forward Miles Bridges and veteran forward Gordon Hayward — although he has struggled to stay healthy since joining Charlotte two seasons ago — have all had success in the league.NBACarter-Vickers agrees to 4-year contract with CelticCurry's diagnosis for Game 4 of finals: 'I'm going to play'Overlooked no more, Brown shines for Celtics in FinalsNo. 1?

The 2020-21 season was considered a playoffs-or-bust season for Charlotte, and it failed to advance to a playoff series.___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
