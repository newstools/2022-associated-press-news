BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — A 120-mile (193-kilometer) stretch of Alabama railway is in line for improvements with help from a $5 million federal grant.The Federal Railroad Administration on Thursday announced the grant from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements program. Nationally, it is awarding $368 million to 46 projects in 32 states and the District of Columbia, al.com reported.The grant will finance improvements to the Alabama Tennessee Riverway, a stretch of track extending from Birmingham to the rail barge terminal at the Port of Guntersville.The project includes upgrading tracks to handle increased traffic and eliminating defects at nine bridges to allow them to handle load capacities in the 286,000-pound (129,727-kilogram) range.Workers will also reactivate rockslide warning signals to allow for 25 mph (40 kph) train speeds between Birmingham and Ragland.Officials say the improvements will increase capacity, speed and efficiency, as well as remove safety risks posed by rail switching operations across Alabama 144. That will allow goods to travel faster and safer and cut down on shipping costs, as well as supply chain problems, officials said.The funding also covers a larger mandate of the Biden Administration’s infrastructure law, which requires at least 25% of funding go to rural projects.
