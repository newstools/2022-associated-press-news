LEEDS, England (AP) — The Overton twins did get to play test cricket together for England, after all.Even if it was only for a few minutes.Jamie Overton made his debut for England in the third test against New Zealand at Headingley on Thursday after being picked ahead of his twin Craig, who was also in the squad.Craig, the older of the 28-year-old brothers by three minutes, did get to come on the field, though — for an over or two — as a substitute fielder when Jonny Bairstow went off.Still, the record book will not say they were officially the first twins to play together for England, the England and Wales Cricket Board said. Craig and Jamie would both have had to be selected in the starting XI for that to be the case.With their parents watching on, Craig presented a first cap to Jamie ahead of the match in Leeds.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
