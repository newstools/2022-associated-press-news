BOSTON (AP) — Music lovers attending events at Tanglewood this summer will not be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test result for admission, the Boston Symphony Orchestra announced Friday.Face coverings will be optional for the summer season that starts later this month and runs until early September, but are recommended inside Ozawa Hall and the Linde Center for Music and Learning based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, orchestra officials said in a statement.Proof of full vaccination and one booster dose is required for orchestra musicians, BSO staff, the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, and guest artists, officials said. Masks will be optional for those groups.Ventilation systems at all indoor spaces accessible to the public at Tanglewood in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts have been evaluated and upgraded where necessary.ADVERTISEMENTTanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra since 1937, is hosting a full schedule of concerts this year for the first time since 2019. The 2020 season was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, and last year’s schedule was pared down.The season opens June 17 with Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band. The first Boston Symphony Orchestra concert is scheduled for July 8.
