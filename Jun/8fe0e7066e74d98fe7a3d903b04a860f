McINTOSH, Ala. (AP) — A British company said Tuesday it plans to construct an $83 million plant in rural southwest Alabama to produce hydrogen gas to meet growing demand.Linde, which describes itself as a leading global gases and engineering company that had $31 billion in sales last year, said it will build the plant in Washington County, located about 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the state’s main port in Mobile.The factory, which will create six manufacturing jobs and positions for 10 truck drivers, will help the company meet demand for liquid hydrogen for companies specializing in aerospace, electronics, manufacturing and mobility, Linde said in a statement released through the Commerce Department.Brenda Tuck, rural development manager for the state commerce agency, said companies have made $2.3 billion in new capital investment in rural counties over the last two years.“The secret is out — these rural locations are ripe for growth and offer high-performance companies a number of strategic advantages,” she said in a statement.The plant is expected to begin operating in 2024.
