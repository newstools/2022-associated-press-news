Jesse Kiehl, who was an aide to Egan and elected to the seat Egan had held, described Egan as charming and “larger than life.”“I once watched him tell a lobbyist there was no way he’d ever vote for a bill, and the guy still left with a smile on his face,” Kiehl said in a statement. ”Dennis always listened to his community, was a straight shooter and truly respected the people around him.
