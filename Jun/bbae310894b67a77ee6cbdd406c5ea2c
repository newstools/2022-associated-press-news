And I can’t support you when there’s other hard working Americans...” the client wrote.Hernandez, whose business is named after her daughter, told AZFamily.com Thursday that she obliged and didn’t want to meet hate with more hate.The Mexican American baker says she has been inundated with orders since sharing the remarks.
