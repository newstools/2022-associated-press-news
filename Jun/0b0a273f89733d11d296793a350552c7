SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — Two Southern California tax preparers each pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges they filed 433 phony tax returns using stolen identities as part of a $1 million fraud scheme, prosecutors said. Anton Nguyen, 53, of Fountain Valley, and Rosemary Pham, 64, of Midway City, were arraigned on charges including conspiracy to defraud the United States, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a statement. Trial was scheduled for July 26. The two are accused of using stolen identities provided by John Tran, a Fountain Valley social worker, to generate fraudulent tax returns, the statement said. In addition, Nguyen and Pham allegedly used stolen identities to receive fraudulent welfare benefits, prosecutors said. Tran, who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in 2019, will be sentenced July 25.
