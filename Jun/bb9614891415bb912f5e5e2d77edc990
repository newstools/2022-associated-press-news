NEW YORK (AP) — A woman was fatally struck by a New York City subway train after she fell onto the tracks at Grand Central Terminal, police said Wednesday.The 20-year-old woman somehow fell onto the tracks as a No. 7 train approached shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday, a police spokesperson said.The train operator was unable to brake in time to avoid hitting the woman, police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.Transit officials announced a plan earlier this year to install safety barriers in three of the city’s subway stations in a pilot program intended to prevent deaths on the tracks. But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that a survey of the 472 stations in the subway system found that just 41 of them could be retrofitted with the barriers today.
