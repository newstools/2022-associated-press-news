MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A divided Wisconsin Supreme Court on Tuesday said the state health department can release data on coronavirus outbreak cases, information sought two years ago near the beginning of the pandemic.The court ruled 4-3 against Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobbying group, which had sought to block release of the records requested in June 2020 by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and other news outlets.The state health department in the early months of the pandemic in 2020 had planned to release the names of more than 1,000 businesses with more than 25 employees where at least two workers have tested positive for COVID-19.Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, along with the Muskego Area Chamber of Commerce and the New Berlin Chamber of Commerce, sued to block the release of the records, saying it would “irreparably harm” the reputations of their members. It argued that the information being sought is derived from diagnostic test results and the records of contact tracers, and that such information constitutes private medical records that can’t be released without the consent of each individual.ADVERTISEMENTAttorneys for the state argued that the information contained aggregate numbers only, not personal information, and could be released.COVID-19US sees heightened extremist threat heading into midtermsUK Boris Johnson's ups and downs: key events in his careerFrench medics protest hospital crisis, deepened by COVIDFour states receive first allocations of $10B broadband fundA Waukesha County circuit judge sided with the business group and blocked release of the records.
