TOKYO (AP) — World shares were mixed Thursday, with European benchmarks opening higher after a broad decline in Asia. Oil prices fell by more than $2 a barrel ahead of a meeting of OPEC set for later in the day. Oil-producing nations are expected to decide on output targets in their first meeting since Europe set sanctions on Russian crude. The Financial Times reported Saudi Arabia has indicated to western allies it could raise production to cover any substantial fall in Russian production. Supply bottlenecks would persist, Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary, “but it would be a rare piece of good news for the global economy and the inflation fight.”France’s CAC 40 gained 1.0% in early trading to 6,481.90, while Germany’s DAX added 0.8% to 14,454.96.

Daily market swings have become routine amid worries that too-aggressive rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve may force the American economy into a recession. Even if it can avoid choking off the economy, higher rates put downward pressure on stocks and other investments regardless. High inflation is meanwhile eating into corporate profits, while the war in Ukraine and business-slowing, anti-COVID-19 restrictions in China have also weighed on markets.
