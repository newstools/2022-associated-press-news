ELMAU, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the G-7 summit, the annual meeting of the leading democratic economies, which this year is being held in the Bavarian Alps in Germany; and on the NATO summit in Madrid, where leaders begin gathering later Tuesday:___ISTANBUL — Turkey’s president says he spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday morning and may meet with him at this week’s NATO summit in Madrid.Biden “expressed his desire to get together again tonight or tomorrow and we said ‘possible’,” Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a press conference in Ankara ahead of his departure to Spain.He said the pair would discuss Turkey’s requests for upgraded F-16s but said there were “diversionary tactics” at play. He didn’t elaborate.Erdogan is also infuriated by U.S. military bases in Greece and says the U.S. has been fixated on Turkey’s purchase of Russian-made S-400 missiles — a step that led to Ankara being kicked off the F-35 stealth jet program.ADVERTISEMENTErdogan confirmed he plans to meet with the leaders of Sweden and Finland, along with NATO’s secretary general, to continue discussions on Turkey’s objections to the two Nordic countries’ NATO membership bids. Ankara has objected to Sweden and Finland’s bid to join NATO, citing what it considers to be their lax approach toward groups Turkey deems national security threats, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, and its Syrian extension. American support for Syrian Kurdish fighters in combatting the Islamic State group has also enraged Turkey for years.G-7 SummitZelenskyy tells G-7 summit Ukraine forces face urgent momentTale of 2 summits: 'America's back' to America's backslidingLive updates | Erdogan adamant on Sweden, Finland NATO bidsG-7 leaders wrap up summit meant to bolster Ukraine support___KEY DEVELOPMENTS:— Zelenskyy tells G-7 summit Ukraine forces face urgent moment— The AP Interview: Spanish PM says NATO summit to show unity— NATO holds summit with gaze on Russia — and China— Tale of 2 summits: ‘America’s back’ to America’s backsliding___OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Western leaders are “working on” a plan to free millions of tons of grain stuck in war-torn Ukraine due to Russia’s invasion.Vast amounts of corn and other grains are stranded in Ukraine — one of the world’s largest producers — and because Russian forces have blocked the country’s ports.Asked by reporters at the start of a Tuesday meeting at the Group of Seven summit what was being done to solve the problem, Johnson said officials were trying to find a solution.“We’re all working on that,” Johnson said.His comments came at the start of a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.___U.S. President Joe Biden is leaving the Group of Seven summit in Germany earlier than scheduled due to bad weather.Biden had been scheduled to deliver remarks during Tuesday’s closing session of the gathering of leaders of developed economies before flying by helicopter to Munich.
