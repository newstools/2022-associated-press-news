BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A couple that runs a Bismarck spa have been charged with promoting prostitution. The Bismarck Tribune reported Monday that David Coble and Yanhong Liu Coble each face up to five years in prison if convicted. According to court documents, police began investigating Cherry Blossom Spa in 2021 after a man reported he’d been inappropriately touched there. Three men told investigators that they paid cash for sex acts. Police used bank records and records from the secretary of state’s office to verify that David Coble was once the registered agent for the spa but Yanhong Liu Coble is now the owner. David Coble’s attorney said David Coble denies the charge. Court records didn’t list an attorney for Yanhong Liu Coble.
