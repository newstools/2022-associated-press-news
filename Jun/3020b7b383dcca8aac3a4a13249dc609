ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Water-dropping aircraft from Azerbaijan and Qatar on Friday joined the fight against a wind-stoked wildfire that burned for a fourth day near a popular resort in southwestern Turkey. Turkey’s forestry minister, meanwhile, said the fire may be close to being contained but the wind still poses a risk.The fire erupted Tuesday in the Bordubet region, near Marmaris on the Aegean Sea coast, and spread rapidly, blackening swaths of pine forest and driving hundreds of people from their homes. At least 29 people were affected by the blaze and 12 of them were taken to hospitals for treatment, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter. Two people remain hospitalized, he said.“The distress is, to a great extent, over,” Vahit Kirisci, the agriculture and forestry minister, told reporters, cautioning that the wind remains a threat.Authorities on Thursday detained a 34-year-old man who allegedly confessed to having started the fire following a row with family members, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said.
