FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took action Thursday to prevent price gouging amid a nationwide baby formula shortage, and he requested short-term relief for Louisville-area motorists forced to pay more at the pump for reformulated gas.The Democratic governor’s actions were aimed at pressing issues facing consumers amid what he calls the “challenging present” caused by rampant inflation and supply chain disruptions.Beshear signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency over the baby formula shortage. The emergency — which lasts for 30 days under state law — activates price-gouging laws to protect families from “predatory pricing” at a time when baby formula supplies are limited, he said.The governor took the preemptive action without having received any reports of price gouging.“We can’t wait for somebody to increase the price double or triple,” he said at a news conference. “We’ve got to enter this order right now so people know that if they try to take advantage of moms and dads who are rightfully frightened ... that we have the safeguards already in place.”ADVERTISEMENTMeanwhile, the governor said he sent a letter to top federal environmental regulators requesting a waiver to remove the requirement that costlier but cleaner-burning reformulated fuel be sold in Metro Louisville. If approved, the waiver would be in effect for up to 20 days, he said.“We’re looking at what is possible after that,” Beshear said. “But my understanding under the federal law is that is the initial waiver period.”Several Republican state lawmakers on Thursday urged Beshear to request that the reformulated fuel requirement be suspended in Jefferson County and parts of Bullitt and Oldham counties.
