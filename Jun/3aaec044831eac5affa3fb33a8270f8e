NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) — New Zealand extended its lead over England to 128 runs after moving to 114-2 by tea on Day 4 of the second test on Monday.Having dismissed England for 539 before lunch to take a 14-run lead into the second innings, the New Zealanders are looking to push the hosts out of contention for a series-clinching victory at Trent Bridge.Tom Latham (4) and Devon Conway (52) were the batsmen to lose their wickets, leaving Will Young (49 not out) and Henry Nicholls (3 not out) in the middle at the end of the second session.Jimmy Anderson claimed the 650th wicket of his career when Latham left a delivery from round the wicket from the 39-year-old pacer that swung in and splattered the stumps.A reverse sweep for four off spinner Jack Leach brought up Conway’s fourth half-century in his ninth test but he departed when choosing to play a traditional sweep. He top-edged it and Bairstow took a catch on the dive coming in from square leg.ADVERTISEMENTEarlier, England added 66 runs to its overnight total of 473-5 as left-arm fast bowler Trent Boult claimed his 10th five-wicket haul in test matches.Joe Root started aggressively, hitting a six from a reverse-scoop shot typically seen in white-ball cricket, before hammering Boult to Tom Southee at short extra cover for 176.
