NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A man was fatally shot by police following a domestic disturbance in a North Little Rock home, authorities said Sunday. North Little Rock police say they were dispatched to a domestic disturbance call with a weapon around 10:40 p.m. Saturday. At the home, officers found a man with a firearm and several other individuals. Police say officers evacuated the others in the home and unsuccessfully tried to communicate with the armed man. When members of the police department’s SWAT team entered the home in an attempt to arrest the man, gunfire was exchanged, according to police. Authorities allege the man shot and injured a police officer and a police dog before he was fatally shot. The officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries while the dog was treated at a local animal hospital. The name of the man who was killed was not immediately released by authorities. The officers involved in the fatal shooting have been placed on administrative leave while authorities investigate the man’s death, police said.
