The TV also said the accused was tasked with rallying workers and teachers for street protests.In May, Iran confirmed it has detained two French citizens, Cecile Kohler, 37, and Jacques Paris, 69, saying they met with protesting teachers, took part in an anti-government rally, and were organizing a protest to create unrest in Iran.France identified the two as a teachers’ union official and her partner who were on vacation in Iran. Teachers have held several strikes and protests in cities across Iran in recent weeks, walking out of their classrooms to press for better pay and working conditions.
