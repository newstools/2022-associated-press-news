NEW YORK (AP) — Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees avoided an arbitration hearing Friday by agreeing to a $19 million, one-year contract, a deal that leaves the slugger on track to become a free agent after the World Series.Unable to agree to a long-term deal in talks that ended on opening day, the sides split the difference between the proposed arbitration figures they exchanged on March 22: $21 million by Judge and $17 million by the Yankees.Judge can make an additional $500,000 in award bonuses: $250,000 for MVP and $250,000 for World Series MVP.“Excited that that’s that’s behind us and we can leave that portion of the show alone,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.Telephone talks resumed this week, and the sides reached the deal just before they were to exchange written evidence they intended to present during a Zoom hearing before a three-person panel scheduled to start at noon EDT.ADVERTISEMENTThe slugging outfielder is in the midst of perhaps his best season, batting .304 with a major league-leading 27 homers and 53 RBIs in 68 games.
