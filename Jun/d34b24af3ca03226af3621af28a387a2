Authorities in El Salvador said a half dozen people had died during a week of rains influenced by Blas and other weather systems.The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Blas had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) at midafternoon. It was centered about 210 miles (340 kilometers) south-southwest of Manzanillo and it was heading to the west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).Forecasters expected Blas to start weakening Friday night as it stayed over open waters and moved farther out into the Pacific. But they added that the hurricane was bringing dangerous surf to the Pacific coast.ADVERTISEMENTThe port captain of Puerto Escondido in the Mexican state of Oaxaca announced that the port was closed to navigation as of Wednesday afternoon.The region to the southeast of Puerto Escondido was battered when Hurricane Agatha, came ashore near Puerto Angel on May 30 with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph).
