MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — State troopers in Alabama investigated four traffic fatalities and three drownings over Memorial Day weekend, the state agency said Wednesday. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency released the statistics in a news release. Three drivers and one motorcyclist were killed in traffic crashes. The fatal crashes occurred in Dallas, Shelby, St. Clair and Tuscaloosa counties. The agency’s Marine Patrol Division investigated three drownings over the weekend, the agency said. “Notifying the next of kin following a fatal crash or drowning is a responsibility troopers dread most, particularly during a fun-filled holiday weekend. We cannot stress enough the importance of simply buckling up and practicing good driving and boating behaviors,” Law Enforcement Agency Secretary Hal Taylor said.
