FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear named 17 people on Tuesday to serve on a medical marijuana advisory team that he formed by an executive order.Justice and Public Safety Cabinet Secretary Kerry Harvey and Public Protection Cabinet Secretary Ray Perry will serve as co-chairs of the panel, which includes health care professionals, members of law enforcement and advocates for medical marijuana, Beshear said in a statement.The committee will travel around the state to gather views on the issue and provide feedback to the governor’s office.The move comes after a bill to legalize medical cannabis died in the state Senate after the House passed it. Republicans have supermajorities in both chambers.The Democratic governor said there seems to be strong support for medical cannabis and that Kentucky has fallen behind the majority of states that have made it available as an alternative to opioid medications.ADVERTISEMENTMany in Kentucky could benefit from using medical cannabis, but continue to suffer, Beshear said.“It is simply time that something more is done,” he said. “I want to make sure every voice is heard as I am weighing executive action that could provide access to medical cannabis in the commonwealth.”
