GENEVA (AP) — Talks went down to the wire Thursday as the World Trade Organization was set to wrap up its first ministerial-level meeting in more than four years, with no firm deal so far on issues like food security, the fight against overfishing in the seas, and efforts to broaden access to COVID-19 vaccines. Western diplomats were pointing fingers at India’s delegation in particular, accusing it of blocking agreement on issues like a waiver of WTO rules that protect patents behind COVID-19 vaccines and a bid to reduce government subsidies that help industrial-sized fishing operations that scoop up huge catches, while protecting the livelihoods of small-scale fishermen.India was holding its ground, positioning itself as a leading voice for developing countries that have resisted what they perceive as high-handed demands by Western powers trying to protect the diversity of ocean wildlife and the innovations of their lucrative pharmaceutical industries.ADVERTISEMENTAs the deadline for the talks neared, a Geneva-based trade official said Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal “has been very much involved in trying to reach compromise.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to provide details from the closed-door discussions.COVID-19Detroit honors Vincent Chin, Asian American killed in 1982Qatar Airways posts record $1.5B profits ahead of World CupBank of England hikes interest rates but resists bolder moveEU beefs up disinformation code amid Russia fake news fearsAmbitions to strike deals at the WTO are, in many ways, a victim of the organization’s own structure: the 164-member trade body operates by consensus, meaning every single country has to sign off on decisions or at least not get in the way.

WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala set up talks with the U.S. and European Union to work on a compromise text. Many activist groups oppose the proposed changes, saying they don’t go far enough to help fight a once-in-a-century pandemic or prepare for the next one.

Talks on the issue have been going on at the WTO for the last two decades.
