It said the current concussion guidelines failed to protect player safety and urged the introduction of trials for temporary concussion substitutes.ADVERTISEMENTThe approval of teams having 15 players on the bench as possible substitutes — at the discretion of the respective competition organizer — paves the way for 26-man squads at the upcoming World Cup in Qatar.FIFA President Gianni Infantino said Monday the majority of coaches of teams qualified for the World Cup wanted to have the three extra players rather than the standard 23-player squad.
