An estimated 20,000 people turned out to watch Tom Slingsby’s Australia SailGP team win its home event in December 2021.Slingsby, the team’s driver and chief executive, said it was good to get the race locked in for the next three years “on the most beautiful harbor in the world.”“We’ve been sort of living on a year-by-year, fingers-crossed basis,“ Slingsby said. “So to secure our future in Sydney is unbelievable for us. We should have great wind, great weather that time of year and it’d been great to win on home soil again.”There are 10 teams competing in Season 3, including new franchises Canada and Switzerland and returning teams Australia, Denmark, France, Britain, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United States.ADVERTISEMENTIn the opening race of the season in Bermuda in May, Slingsby hit the starting line in the podium race in control and sailed ahead of Britain’s Ben Ainslie and Canada’s Phil Robertson for an easy win, reaching 42 mph (68 kph) as his 50-foot catamaran.SportsWarriors beat Celtics 103-90 to win 4th NBA title in 8 yearsAfter good rise, Tatum, Celtics fall flat late in NBA FinalsFIFA picks 2026 World Cup cities, predicts US `No 1 sport'Excitement and disappointment as World Cup 2026 cities namedThe victory came just six weeks after the Aussies’ dominating win in the $1 million, winner-take-all grand final of the pandemic-delayed Season 2 on San Francisco Bay.
