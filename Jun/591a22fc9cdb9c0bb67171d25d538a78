PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Philadelphia district attorney’s office says an arrest warrant has been approved in the shooting death of one of the three people killed when gunfire broke out in an entertainment district in the city over the weekend.Prosecutors said Wednesday that no information would be released until the individual was in custody in connection with the homicide of one of the two people believed to have been innocent bystanders hit by gunfire during Saturday night’s shooting on South Street that also wounded 11 other people.Officials lauded cooperation from residents and local businesses and said they hoped to “have a legal and factual basis to issue an arrest warrant for the second homicide in the next several days.” Police on Tuesday released a photo of a person wanted in connection with the shooting who should be considered armed and dangerous. Authorities have said the gunfire started with a fight between two people who then began firing a total of 17 shots at each other. One man, 34-year-old Gregory Jackson, was killed, and the other wounded; no charges are planned in that case since both had permits to carry and that shooting is considered self-defense, authorities said.Politics4th grade Uvalde survivor: 'I don't want it to happen again'Armed man arrested for threat to kill Justice Kavanaugh‘Great resignation’ reaches White House with staff turnoverHouse passes gun control bill after Buffalo, Uvalde attacksADVERTISEMENTAuthorities have said that the other two people killed, 27-year-old Alexis Quinn and an unidentified 22-year-old man, as well as many of the other people wounded by gunfire — who ranged in age from 17 to 69 — are believed to have been innocent bystanders.Authorities earlier announced two arrests not connected with any of the deaths.Quran Garner, 18, is charged with aggravated assault, assault of a law enforcement officer and weapons counts.

The Defender Association of Philadelphia, representing Garner, declined comment; no attorney is listed for Vereen and a message couldn’t be left at a number listed for him.Officials have said another person who may have fired shots that night is also being sought but have released no information about who that might be or what charges that person might face.
