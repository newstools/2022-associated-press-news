BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — State animal health officials have extended a ban poultry events indefinitely as a bird flu outbreak continues. The Bismarck Tribune reported the State Board of Animal Health canceled all shows, public sales, swaps and exhibitions of poultry and other birds in March at the North Dakota Turkey Federation’s request to help slow the disease. The board on Thursday decided to continue the ban until further notice. Private sales, catalog sales and retail sales are still permitted. The board will review risk factors at its Sept. 7 meeting. Bird flu has infected 15 flocks in 10 North Dakota counties, including four commercial operations. About 167,000 birds have been destroyed, according to federal data.Nationwide, the outbreak has resulted in the slaughter of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in 36 states. The outbreak is the worst since 2015, when 50 million chickens and turkeys were killed.
