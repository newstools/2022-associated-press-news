BOSTON (AP) — The developers of an offshore wind farm and three environmental organizations announced Monday that they have reached an agreement to further protect rare North Atlantic right whales during construction and operation of the energy-generating project.The agreement involving Orsted and Eversource — developers of South Fork Wind off the coast of New England and New York — was signed by the National Wildlife Federation, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Conservation Law Foundation, the groups said in a joint statement.The agreement promotes the development of sustainable energy while protecting wildlife, said Alison Chase, a senior policy analyst at the NRDC.“We don’t need to choose between clean energy development and wildlife protection, and this agreement shows how we can do both,” she said.There is estimated to be fewer than 340 North Atlantic right whales remaining, according to marine scientists. They are threatened by changing prey and habitat caused by climate change, entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes.ADVERTISEMENTUnder Monday’s agreement, South Fork Wind will adopt monitoring measures to help ensure right whales are not close to the site during active construction. South Fork Wind will also work to reduce noises made by pile driving and implement a 10-knot speed limit for project-related vessels to cut the risk of vessel strikes.ClimateBiden aims at China in new illegal fishing policy frameworkQatar Energy to cut emissions as methane movement growsNot enough or too far?

It’s expected to provide roughly 130 megawatts, enough power for about 70,000 homes. Its transmission system will connect to the electric grid on Long Island, New York, making it the state’s first offshore wind farm and jumpstarting the offshore wind industry there.The project broke ground early this year and is expected to be operational late next year.Developing offshore wind energy is a key policy of the Biden administration, which wants to wants to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030 — enough electricity to power more than 10 million homes. Some in the commercial fishing industry have said planned offshore wind projects off the East Coast would make it difficult to harvest valuable seafood species, while some fear that the large turbines would kill birds.
