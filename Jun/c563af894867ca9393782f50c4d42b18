CHARLOTTE, Tenn. (AP) — Heidi Thayer and her mother opened The Courtside Cafe inside a former service station in Charlotte, Tennessee, more than two decades ago. But on Friday, it was her customers that were doing the cooking. Friends and supporters were selling hamburgers, chips, drinks and desserts to raise money to help Thayer after her husband suffered an aneurysm, The Tennessean reported. “Courtside is a big part of Charlotte and we love it,” said co-organizer Willie Speight. “They have the best hamburgers so that’s one reason why we thought we would do hamburgers.” The restaurant just off the historic town square has been closed about two months and the medical bills are piling up. But Thayer said her husband is making progress. “The outpouring of love and generosity from our community has been so overwhelming,” Thayer said. “There just aren’t any words to fully express our gratitude.”
