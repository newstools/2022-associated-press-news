Super long and a lot of par fives, long par fours, so it’s going to be a great test this week.”Wil Besseling was a shot back in third place despite a double bogey on the 17th. He is one stroke ahead of seven players who are tied for fourth. They include Victor Perez, fresh off winning the Dutch Open on Sunday in a playoff.Marcus Armitage, who won his first DP World Tour title in Hamburg last year, was 3 over after the first 10 holes of his opening round at Green Eagle Golf Courses, but played the remaining eight in 5 under to card a 70.Two-time major winner Martin Kaymer announced his withdrawal shortly before play began, citing inflammation in his wrist.___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
