CASTAIC, Calif. (AP) — Six people suffered burn injuries under unclear circumstances Tuesday in Southern California’s Angeles National Forest, authorities said. Emergency crews responded shortly after 11 a.m. following reports of burned patients on Templin Highway near Castaic, said Esteban Benitez, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Four people were transported to hospitals in helicopters and two were taken by ambulances, Benitez said. All had second-degree burns, he said. The county fire department said additional details were not immediately available. Initial reports were that a county fire crew was taking part in a training exercise at the site, according to Officer Josh Greengard with the California Highway Patrol.An ABC7 helicopter showed firefighters, fire vehicles and helicopters on the highway, along with a group of about about a dozen people in orange outfits seated on the roadside. Old Golden State Highway, just west of Interstate 5, was shut down to land rescue helicopters in the area about 45 miles (72 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
