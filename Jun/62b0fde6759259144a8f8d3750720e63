He ran and physically resisted Schurr after failing to produce a driver’s license.Schurr, who is white, claimed Lyoya had control of his Taser when he shot him. Defense attorneys said the officer feared for his safety when he shot Lyoya.The confrontation and shooting were recorded on video.ADVERTISEMENTSchurr had been on leave while state police investigated the shooting and prosecutor Chris Becker decided whether to pursue charges.
