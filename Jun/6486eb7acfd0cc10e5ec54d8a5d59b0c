YOU LIKE STRIKEOUTS?Mississippi pitchers averaged 15.3 strikeouts per nine innings in regionals and the tournament field’s overall rate was a record 8.86. The trend has been for strikeouts to go up in super regionals and the CWS.Walks are up, too. There were 4.54 per nine innings, most since at least 2015. Arkansas allowed 6.57.VOLS DO IT ALLBarring a flameout, any conversation about most dominant college baseball teams in history must include Tennessee, which is the first team to lead the nation in both home runs (150) and ERA (2.38).The Volunteers’ 56-7 record gives them a winning percentage (.889) on track to be highest since Oregon State went 56-6 (.903) in 2017. Outstanding pitching carried the Beavers that season but their offensive numbers were modest.Tennessee’s homer total is highest since LSU hit 157 in 1998 and ranks sixth all-time. Nine players have double-digit homers. The Vols are the only team this season with an ERA under 3.00, and they also lead the nation in several other pitching categories.BEEN THERE, DONE THATArkansas’ four straight super regional appearances lead the nation. East Carolina, Mississippi and Stanford are in supers for a third time in a row.Texas’ winning percentage of .729 in regionals and super regionals is best in the field and second all-time among teams that have played a minimum of 25 such games.WELCOME ABOARDVirginia Tech is the only team making its first appearance in super regionals. Few expected the Hokies to be here. They were picked second-to-last in the ACC Coastal Division and started 0-4 in conference play. They ended up winning the ACC regular-season title and recording their most wins (44) since 1985. They enter supers having won 34 of their last 40.ADVERTISEMENTWELCOME BACKSouthern Mississippi is making its second appearance in super regionals and first since 2009. That was the year the Golden Eagles made it to the CWS under Corky Palmer. Current coach Scott Berry was an assistant on the ’09 team.ROAD WARRIORSConnecticut, which won two of three at Maryland on its way to supers, takes a nation-high 25 road wins into its series at Stanford. This will be the Huskies’ second trip to California this season. They went 5-3 against Pepperdine, Southern California, Long Beach State and San Diego.GAME 1 MEANS A LOTThe team that wins Game 1 of its super regional has advanced to the CWS 80% of the time (140 of 176) since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. Eleven of the last 12 national champions won their super regional openers.ELKO EN FUEGOMississippi first baseman Tim Elko must be glad he took advantage of the extra season of eligibility granted by the NCAA because of the pandemic. He was his regional’s MVP after batting .778 with three homers and three doubles, a 2.111 slugging percentage and .857 on-base percentage.EAST CAROLINA CURSE?ADVERTISEMENTEast Carolina holds the dubious distinction of having made the most NCAA Tournament appearances (31) without making a CWS. Coach Cliff Godwin didn’t bite Thursday when a reporter mentioned how much a breakthrough would mean to the program.The Pirates are 1-12 all-time in super regionals with six straight losses since Godwin won his super regional opener in 2016.East Carolina got out to a 14-13 start before running off to the American Athletic Conference regular-season title by six games and then sweeping through the league tournament.“I’m going to be honest with you,” Godwin said, “I haven’t thought about Omaha a lot this year. This team has been playing playoff baseball for about 2 1/2 months, when we were 14-13 and every game mattered.”
