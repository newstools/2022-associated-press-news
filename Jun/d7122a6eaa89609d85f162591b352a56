He reached base for the fifth time in five plate appearances with a walk, loading the bases in the eighth and later scoring on Zach Levenson’s two-run single for an 11-5 lead. Canisius (29-23) had its six-game win streak snapped. Mike DeStefano went 3-for-4 with a walk, an RBI and two runs scored for the Golden Griffins. Mike Steffan was 3-for-5 with a double and two RBIs and Trevor Henneman hit a solo homer.ADVERTISEMENTCJ Kayfus, Burke, Levenson and Dorian Gonzalez Jr. had two hits apiece for the Hurricanes.

The game — the first between the programs and the regional opener — originally was scheduled for noon Friday but was twice pushed back due to a tropical storm in the area. ___More AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
