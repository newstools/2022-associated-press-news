She is feeling much better and using today to rest,” USA Artistic Swimming told The Associated Press in a statement.ADVERTISEMENT“Watching yesterday’s medical emergency of 2x Olympian Anita Alvarez and subsequent rescue by coach Andrea Fuentes was heartbreaking for our community.

Marathon, cycling, cross country… we all have seen images where some athletes don’t make it to the finish line and others help them to get there. Our sport is no different than others, just in a pool, we push through limits and sometimes we find them.”___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
