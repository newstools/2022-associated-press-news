New York’s Republican Party chair, Nick Langworthy, entered a closely watched upstate congressional race on Friday, setting up a three-way primary for the reconfigured district.He will compete against Buffalo developer Carl Paladino and business owner Marc Cenedella in the 23rd Congressional District, which includes parts of western New York and the Southern Tier.Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Jacobs said he would not seek reelection after facing backlash from his own party for voicing support for an assault weapons ban following the May 14 mass shooting in his hometown of Buffalo.“I can provide an alternative in this race: someone who can go and advocate for strong conservative Republican values without distraction and without any baggage,” Langworthy said in an interview.Langworthy’s announcement comes at the end of a week during which Paladino has faced scrutiny over his racist and antisemitic remarks and a social media post promoting mass shooting conspiracies.ADVERTISEMENTOn Friday, Paladino said he was wrong to invoke Hitler in an interview last year by saying he was “the kind of leader we need today” because of his ability to rally crowds.Paladino earlier this week then deleted a conspiracy-laden Facebook post suggesting a racist mass shooting in his hometown of Buffalo and other mass killings were part of a plot to take away people’s guns.2022 Midterm electionsJan. 6 hearings remind some voters of Watergate, Iran-ContraState high court won't put ousted GOP hopeful back on ballotNY Assembly primaries to proceed; court orders new 2024 mapsGOP dealing with spam attack on convention registrationsPaladino was ousted from the Buffalo School Board in 2016 amid an uproar over racist statements he wrote about President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama.And during his campaign to win the Republican nomination for governor in 2010, Paladino was widely criticized over a pattern of forwarding racist jokes about Black people to a circle of friends. Paladino apologized and won the party’s nomination.On Friday, Langworthy said Paladino doesn’t speak for the state Republican Party and called his comments about Hitler “reprehensible.” “It’s reprehensible to talk about Adolf Hitler to talk about in any positive fashion,” Langworthy said.Langworthy said he was already preparing for a run for Congress before Paladino faced criticism this week: “This isn’t an 11th hour thing.”The Aug. 23 primary will mark the first appearance on a ballot for Langworthy, 41, a former Erie County GOP chair who was on the executive committee of former President Donald Trump’s transition team. He has the Conservative Party’s endorsement.Langworthy’s announcement video emphasized his ties to Trump, “When the Republican Party needed new leadership, President Trump called on me to turn things around,” he said.
