LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles Chargers controlling owner Dean Spanos has been accused of repeated breaches of fiduciary duty and misogynistic behavior in a lawsuit filed by his sister.The filing escalates the ongoing battle among the four Spanos siblings over control of the franchise.Dea Spanos Berberian filed a petition Thursday in San Joaquin County Superior Court seeking sole control of the family trust that has a 36% stake in the ownership of the Chargers. The lawsuit also asks the court to suspend and remove Dean Spanos as a co-trustee in the trust and for the disqualification of Michael Spanos as successor co-trustee.A lawyer representing Dean and Michael Spanos was reviewing the filing before commenting on their behalf.Spanos and Berberian were left as co-trustees of the trust following the deaths of Alex and Faye Spanos in 2018.Of the remaining 64% of the Chargers ownership stake, Spanos, Berberian, Alexandra Spanos Ruhl and Michael Spanos each own 15%. The remaining 4% is owned by non-family members.ADVERTISEMENTAlex Spanos bought the San Diego Chargers in 1984 and Dean Spanos took over managing the franchise in 1994.In the filing, Berberian accuses Michael and Dean Spanos of repeatedly acting “out of their deeply-held misogynistic attitudes and sense of entitlement as the men in the family.” It states that Dean and Michael “believe to their cores that, regardless of what their parents intended and their wills specified, men are in charge and women should shut up.”NFLJack Del Rio fined $100K for comments about Capitol riotPanthers owner sued by York County over practice facilityRaiders agree to 2-year extension with Hunter RenfrowReal Madrid, Barcelona to meet in Las Vegas during US tourAccording to the trust’s financial statements, debts totaled over $358 million as of Dec. 31, with debt service and expenses of at least $11 million per year.
