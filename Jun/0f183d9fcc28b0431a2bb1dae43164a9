BEIJING (AP) — China’s trade growth rebounded in May after anti-virus restrictions that shut down Shanghai and other industrial centers began to ease.Exports surged 16.9% over a year ago to $308.3 billion, up from April’s 3.7% growth, a customs agency statement said Thursday. Imports rose gained 4.1% to $229.5 billion, accelerating from the previous month’s 0.7%.China’s trade has been dampened this year by weak global demand for its exports and curbs imposed to fight outbreaks in Shanghai, site of the world’s busiest port, and other cities. Consumer demand for imports was crushed by rules that confined millions of families to their homes.Forecasters have cut estimates for China’s economic growth to as low as 2% this year due to the Shanghai shutdown, well below the ruling Communist Party’s target of 5.5%.Most factories, shops and other businesses in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities have been allowed to reopen but are expected to need weeks or months to return to normal activity levels.ADVERTISEMENT“Exports showed considerable resilience in May despite the impact of the protracted lockdown in Shanghai,” said Rajiv Biswas of S&P Global Market Intelligence in a report. “The outlook for the second half of 2022 is for a stronger rebound in imports as domestic demand recovers.”COVID-19New vaccine may be option for troops with religious concernsN Korean ruling party meets amid expectation of nuclear testLive updates | Ukraine says Russia pounding Sievierodonetsk‘Great resignation’ reaches White House with staff turnoverChina’s politically sensitive global trade surplus widened by 82.3% over a year earlier to $78.8 billion.
