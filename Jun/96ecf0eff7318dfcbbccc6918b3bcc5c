AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Maine’s public university system extended the contract of its chancellor into the summer, but has yet to make a decision about his long-term future.Chancellor Dannel Malloy has received votes of no confidence from faculty at three of the system’s campuses. He’s in the midst of a previously scheduled review.The chair of the University of Maine System Board of Trustees announced the short-term contract renewal on Thursday, the Kennebec Journal reported. The extension lasts until the middle of July.Malloy is the former governor of Connecticut and was hired to lead the university system in 2019. He came under scrutiny over the handling of the search for a new president for the system’s Augusta campus.Faculty have also cited the elimination of staff positions at the system’s Farmington campus as a cause for concern.
