NEW YORK (AP) — Privacy advocates are urging New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to affix her signature on a bill that would protect sensitive information gathered from people being vaccinated against COVID-19.Advocates say the unfettered sharing of information could be misused by a raft of entities, including law enforcement who the New York Civil Liberties Union suggests could use that data in criminal proceedings.That possibility, the group said, could be having a chilling effect in the rate of vaccinations among some groups — and hinder public health efforts to further protect the public from the ongoing pandemic and other potential health crises.Vaccine clinics collect a host of personal information, including addresses, phone numbers, insurance information and medical history. Those seeking vaccines are also asked to produce legal identification and, in some cases, been asked to provide Social Security numbers.ADVERTISEMENT“Any number of people are likely to be chilled from receiving vaccines if they believe their personal information will be shared broadly within the government,” said Allie Bohm, the policy counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union.“We’re also thrilled lawmakers took this important stride to make sure vaccine passports do not become another tool that disproportionately hurt people who have suffered the most throughout the pandemic, and we urge Governor Hochul to sign this into law immediately,” Bohm said in a statement.COVID-19Russian agent Kovtun, accused in spy poisoning, dead at 57Teachers after Texas attack: ‘None of us are built for this'As COVID retreats, dragon boat tradition back in south ChinaPolice patrol Hong Kong park to enforce Tiananmen vigil banThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the federal law better known as HIPAA, protects some information but generally applies only to health care providers.
