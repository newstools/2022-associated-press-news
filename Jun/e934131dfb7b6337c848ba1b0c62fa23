KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian bombers have likely been launching 1960s-era heavy, anti-ship missiles meant to destroy aircraft carriers with nuclear warheads against land targets in Ukraine, a British military intelligence report said Saturday.It said the 5.5-ton Kh-22 missiles, when used in ground attacks with conventional warheads, are highly inaccurate and can cause severe collateral damage and casualties.Russia is likely using such weapons because it is running short of more precise modern missiles, Britain’s Defense Ministry said in a daily update. It gave no details of where exactly such missiles are thought to have been deployed and there was no immediate confirmation from Ukrainian authorities of the use of the heavy missiles.Both sides have been expending large amounts of weaponry in what has become a grinding war of attrition for the eastern region of coal mines and factories known as the Donbas, placing huge strains on their resources and stockpiles.ADVERTISEMENTThe area borders Russia and has been partly controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014.The report from the British Defense Ministry said Ukrainian air defenses were still deterring Russian tactical aircraft from carrying out strikes across much of the country.Russia-Ukraine warUkraine: Drivers risk all to bring aid, help civilians fleeLive updates | Biden: Zelenskyy didn't want to hear US infoRussia's central bank cuts interest rates to prewar levelCivilians flee intense fighting in contested eastern UkraineMeanwhile, the Ukrainian army said Russian forces were regrouping to launch an offensive on the city of Sloviansk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.
