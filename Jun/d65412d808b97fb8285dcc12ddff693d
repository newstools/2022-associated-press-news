BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union’s executive branch has proposed a ban on the sale of flavored heated tobacco products as part of its plan to fight cancer. The European Commission said in a statement Wednesday that its proposal comes in response to a significant increase in the volume of such products sold across the 27-nation bloc. A recent commission study showed a 10% increase in sales of heated tobacco products in more than five member nations.
