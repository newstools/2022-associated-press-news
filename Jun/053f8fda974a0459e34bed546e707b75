Intuit also did not notify low-income users they qualified for a genuinely free product through the Internal Revenue Service provided through TurboTax, regardless of their filing status, the attorney general’s office said Thursday in a news release.Indiana’s share is part of a $141 million settlement across 50 states and the District of Columbia.
