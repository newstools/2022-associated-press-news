LAS VEGAS (AP) — A trio of economic reports show that May was a good month for Nevada tourism and gambling, including passenger traffic characterized as the third-busiest ever at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas.The Nevada Gaming Control Board said Thursday that casinos statewide won $1.3 billion last month, the fourth-highest all-time and the 15th month in a row topping the $1 billion mark.Michael Lawton, board senior analyst, said figures reported statewide and from Clark County, downtown Las Vegas and the Strip were the highest so-called “casino win” ever for the month of May.Strip business benefitted from events at T-Mobile Arena, the Electric Daisy Carnival music and entertainment festival at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Pearl Jam and Eagles concerts at MGM Grand Garden Arena, Lawton said.At the airport, spokesman Joe Rajchel said the nearly 4.6 million arriving and departing passengers trailed monthly records set in October 2019 and May 2019 — before the coronavirus pandemic.ADVERTISEMENTThe number was boosted by nearly 800,000 international travelers, compared with about 50,000 a year ago, when almost all overseas flights were suspended during the pandemic.Lawton attributed a jump in casino baccarat play and winnings to the return of international travelers.COVID-19COVID restrictions ease in Shanghai as case numbers dropCalifornia advances bid to create legal drug injection sitesWimbledon updates | Kyrgios fined $10K for conduct in 1st RdCOVID-19 at Wimbledon: 3 top-20 men out after positive testsThe state collected almost $92 million in taxes based on May casino report, the report said.
