WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The Auckland-based Blues have retained the same starting XV that beat the ACT Brumbies 20-19 in the semifinals for Saturday’s Super Rugby Pacific final against the Christchurch-based Crusaders.The one significant change in the Blues’ match-day 23 comes on the bench where All Blacks backrower Dalton Papalii has been provisionally selected. Papalii missed the Blues quarterfinal win over the Highlanders and the semifinal after surgery to have his appendix removed.Head coach Leon MacDonald said Papalii is confident of proving his fitness.“He’s got a few boxes to tick,” MacDonald said. “He’s got to get through a big part of (Thursday’s) training and feel really confident. It’s a big game for him to have any doubts so we want him to come off the grass feeling like he’s ready to go.”James Tucker will play if Papalii is not deemed fit.Saturday’s match is a sell-out with a crowd of 42,000 expected at Auckland’s Eden Park.ADVERTISEMENT___Blues: Stephen Perofeta, A.J.
