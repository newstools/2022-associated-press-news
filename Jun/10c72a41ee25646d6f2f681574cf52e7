Gov. Andy Beshear headed to western Kentucky on Friday to mark another milestone in the recovery from tornadoes that tore through the region six months ago, killing 81 people in the state.The governor was headlining an event in hard-hit Mayfield to celebrate the first fully constructed new homes since the town took a direct hit from a tornado last December.“Today marks six months after the most deadly tornado event our state has ever seen,” Beshear tweeted Friday ahead of the Mayfield event. “This is a time of reflection and hope. Let us continue to remember and lift up the 81 lives lost, their families and communities, and let us continue to work together to support western Kentucky.”Recapping the massive influx of assistance, the governor said Thursday that the response from federal, state and Red Cross efforts have surpassed an estimated $193 million. Nearly 2,600 people have been housed through emergency programs in Kentucky, he said.ADVERTISEMENT“We still have a long way to go” to rebuild from the widespread destruction, Beshear said at his weekly news conference Thursday. But six months after the storms, he said: “We are standing. No longer knocked down. Never knocked out.” More than 2.5 million cubic yards of debris have been removed from storm-stricken Kentucky counties — roughly the equivalent of 250,000 truckloads, the governor said.
