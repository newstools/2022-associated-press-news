ODESSA, Texas (AP) — A West Texas city’s water system lost pressure after a break in a major water main, leaving tens of thousands of customers with dry taps Tuesday.Odessa’s water system’s 165,000 customers’ water taps lost pressure or went completely dry after the 24-inch main broke late Monday afternoon, according to the city’s social media pages. Odessa Mayor Javier Joven declared a state of emergency and issued a boil-water notice for the system’s 165,000 customers that still had water, effective until further notice.“A significant portion of the community remains without water at this time,” the city’s Facebook page said early Tuesday afternoon.Businesses, schools and public agencies remained closed Tuesday because of a lack of water.City officials said Tuesday afternoon that repairs were not expected to be completed until Tuesday night, but the water was not expected to be flowing again until almost midday Wednesday.ADVERTISEMENT“As we have never done this before, (restarting) an entire system like this, we are making those predictions based on a good guess,” said city Utilities Director Thomas Kerr.Water tankers were placed strategically around the city to respond to any fires, said Deputy City Manager Phillip Urrutia.PoliticsBiden tells oil refiners: Produce more gas, fewer profitsLaxalt's Nevada win sets up fierce race for Senate controlRice loses House seat after impeaching Trump; Mace holds onElection 2022 Takeaways: Big Trump win, Nev.
