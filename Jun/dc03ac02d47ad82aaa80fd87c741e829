U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a vote of no-confidence by his Conservative party members, keeping his job but ending up politically damaged. Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal won the French Open, while devotees celebrated the El Rocio pilgrimage in Spain. Police guarded the scene of a gun attack at a Catholic church in southwestern Nigeria and a child received treatment for malnutrition in Somalia.This photo gallery highlights some of the most compelling images made or published in the week by The Associated Press from Europe and Africa.
