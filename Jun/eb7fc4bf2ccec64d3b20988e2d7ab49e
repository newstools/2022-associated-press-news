That allowed for about 650 firefighters supported by water-dumping aircraft to establish a perimeter around the fire that started in Zamora’s Sierra de la Culebra. Authorities warned there was still danger that an unfavorable shift in weather could revive the blaze that caused the evacuation of 18 villages.ADVERTISEMENTSpain has been on alert for an outbreak of intense wildfires as the country swelters under record temperatures at many points in the country for June.
