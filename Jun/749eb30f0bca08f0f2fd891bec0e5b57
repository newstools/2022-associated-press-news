Both are cooperating with the investigation and await sentencing, the Department of Justice said.Prosecutors allege Huizar masterminded a $1.5 million pay-to-play scheme tied to the approval of developments. Huizar and former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Raymond Chan are scheduled to face trial in February on federal charges that include racketeering conspiracy and bribery. They have pleaded not guilty.In another case, former City Council member Mitchell Englander pleaded guilty in 2020 to obstructing an FBI investigation into his acceptance of tens of thousands of dollars in cash, escort services and other perks from a businessman involved in major developments. He was sentenced last year to 14 months in federal prison.
