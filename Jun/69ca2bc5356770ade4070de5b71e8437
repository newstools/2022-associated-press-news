(AP) — Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow, who guided the Ivy League school through the coronavirus pandemic and put together a panel to examine the university’s deep ties to slavery, announced Wednesday that he plans to step down next year.“There is never a good time to leave a job like this one, but now seems right to me,” Bacow, whose last day will be June 30, 2023, said in a letter to the university community. “Through our collective efforts, we have found our way through the pandemic. We have worked together to sustain Harvard through change and through storm, and collectively we have made Harvard better and stronger in countless ways.”He did not announce any future plans other to say he and his wife, Adele, plan to spend more time with their children and grandchildren.Bacow, 70, who took over as president in 2018, expanded and updated the university’s teaching and research missions, and he fostered cooperation across disciplines to address complex issues including climate change and inequality.ADVERTISEMENTAn economist, lawyer and environmental public policy expert by training, he has also been an advocate for the free exchange of ideas. Under his leadership, Harvard joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to make international students leave the country if they planned on taking classes entirely online in the fall of 2020, at the height of the pandemic. He criticized the policy for its “cruelty” and “recklessness.”COVID-19AEW continues to thrive after celebrating 3rd anniversaryHalf of Louisiana town's police department out with COVIDCalifornia native Gregory ready to host full show at SonomaWHO: COVID cases and deaths falling nearly everywhereHarvard became one of the first universities early in the pandemic to switch to remote learning, and Bacow and his wife tested positive for COVID-19 in March 2020.Under his leadership, Harvard announced in 2021 that it would fully divest its $42 billion endowment of fossil fuels holdings, part a wider effort to address climate change.Harvard also faced challenges during his tenure.
