SYDNEY (AP) — Harry Wilson has been rushed into Australia’s starting lineup for the deciding third rugby test against England to add a harder edge in the forwards.Wilson, a standout backrower for the Queensland Reds in Super Rugby, missed selection for the first two tests in Perth and Brisbane after also being omitted from Australia’s end-of-year tour to Europe in 2021.He is one of four changes to Australia’s starting XV for Saturday’s match, with Reece Hodge returning at fullback, lock Nick Frost picked to make his starting debut and veteran James Slipper returning at loosehead prop.Wilson will start on the blindside flank to make his 11th test appearance, joining skipper Michael Hooper and No. 8 Rob Valetini in the backrow. Rob Leota drops to the bench to cover the second and back rows.“Harry and Reece are both super excited to wear the Wallaby gold for the first time this year and have trained extremely well,” Wallabies coach Dave Rennie said in the team announcement Thursday. “We know we’re a much better team than how we played in Brisbane and we’ve had a good week of preparation.”ADVERTISEMENTThe Wallabies won the series opener 30-28, despite being a man down for most of the match in Perth after Darcy Swain was red-carded, and England leveled the series with a 25-17 win in Brisbane.

The Wallabies lost the physical contest over the ball at the start of both tests in the series and Wilson’s inclusion and Leota on the bench for the Sydney test is Rennie’s option to help address that issue and a lack of depth in the second row.Hodge will be the third starting fullback in three tests for Australia, wearing the No. 15 jersey in Sydney after Tom Banks broke his arm in Perth and Jordan Petaia sustained a concussion in the third minute of the second test.Frost will partner Matt Philip in the third different locking combination of the series following Swain’s suspension and Cadeyrn Neville’s injury in the second test.Rennie has also included Reds scrumhalf Tate McDermott on the bench for the first time in the series as backup to starting No. 9 Nic White, and given Suliasi Vunivalu a chance to make his test debut after including the former NRL star in the 23-man matchday squad.—-Australia squad: Reece Hodge, Tom Wright, Hunter Paisami, Samu Kerevi, Marika Koroibete, Noah Lolesio, Nic White; Rob Valetini, Michael Hooper (captain), Harry Wilson, Matt Philip, Nick Frost, Taniela Tupou, David Porecki, James Slipper.
