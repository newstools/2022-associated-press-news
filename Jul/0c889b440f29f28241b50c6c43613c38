ELBERTON, Ga. (AP) — A rural Georgia monument that some conservative Christians have criticized as satanic was bombed before dawn on Wednesday, damaging one of four granite panels that some people dubbed “America’s Stonehenge.”The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the Georgia Guidestones monument near Elberton was damaged by an explosive device.Elberton Granite Association Executive Vice President Chris Kubas told local news outlets that the monument was significantly damaged. Pictures and drone footage show one of the four stone panels in rubble on the ground.The enigmatic roadside attraction was built in 1980 from local granite, commissioned by an unknown person or group under the name R.C. Christian. The 19-foot-high (6-meter-high) panels bear a 10-part message in eight different languages with guidance for living in an “age of reason.” One part calls for keeping world population at 500 million or below, while another calls to “guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.”ADVERTISEMENTIt also serves as a sundial and astronomical calendar.The roadside attraction received renewed attention during Georgia’s May 24 gubernatorial primary when third-place Republican candidate Kandiss Taylor claimed the guidestones are satanic and made demolishing them part of her platform.2022 Midterm electionsNashville bid for GOP convention trips up in metro councilSen.
