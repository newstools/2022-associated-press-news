Some of the people he allegedly stole from had dementia or limited English skills, according to the DOJ. He’s also accused of failing to file the paperwork making one of the victim’s relatives a co-signer on their accounts, which prevented the relative from seeing the victim’s accounts and the fraud.Wells Fargo reimbursed the victims for their loss, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
