SYDNEY (AP) — Australia second rower Darcy Swain has been suspended for two weeks and will miss the final two matches of the England test series after his red card for foul play was upheld by a Rugby World judicial committee.The Wallabies were forced to play a man down for more than half of last Saturday’s first test against England after Swain was sent off in the 34th minute for headbutting opposite Jonny Hill in retaliation. Australia scored three second-half tries to lead 30-14 and won the match 30-28.“Having acknowledged mitigating factors, including the player’s acknowledgement of foul play, clean disciplinary record, conduct at the hearing and expression of remorse, the committee granted the player full mitigation of 50% of three weeks,” the committee said in a statement Tuesday.“The committee further determined that given the above off-field mitigating factors and that a three-week sanction would be wholly disproportionate given the level and nature of the offense, the sanction was further reduced by an extra week.”Swain, a lock, has the right to appeal.The final two matches in the series are this Saturday in Brisbane and July 16 in Sydney.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
