DUBLIN (AP) — New Zealand prop Angus Ta’avao was suspended for three weeks on Tuesday and will miss the series decider against Ireland.Ta’avao was sent off last Saturday in the 30th minute of the second test in Dunedin for a head-on-head tackle of Ireland center Garry Ringrose.Cited for making a dangerous tackle, Ta’avao disputed at his disciplinary hearing that it was a red card offense, but the judiciary upheld the card.However, the judiciary agreed there were mitigating factors, and reduced his sanction from a potential six weeks to three weeks.The panel added that if Ta’avao undertakes a coaching intervention program, his sanction will be reduced by one week.Ireland won the test 23-12, its first over the All Blacks in New Zealand, and the series will be decided this Saturday in Wellington.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
