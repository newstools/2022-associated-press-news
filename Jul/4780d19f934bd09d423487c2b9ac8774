NEW YORK (AP) — Street repairs were underway Tuesday after a van fell into a giant sinkhole in the Bronx.A sinkhole the length of three cars opened up on Radcliff Avenue in the Morris Park neighborhood after heavy rains Monday. Videos that aired on local news stations show a white van tip over on its left side and then plunge into the huge hole.The van’s owner told reporters at the scene that he wasn’t worried. “I’m all right,” he said. “Lose the van … it’s life.”The sinkhole was being filled on Tuesday and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection was investigating the cause of the roadway collapse, department spokesperson Edward Timbers said.Meanwhile, the van was hoisted out of the hole and set upright; the owner got in and drove it off, Timbers said.
