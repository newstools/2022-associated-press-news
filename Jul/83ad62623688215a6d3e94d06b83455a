New York, California and Illinois had the most cases.Nearly all are in men and the vast majority had same-sex encounters, according to the CDC.The vaccine, when properly administered before or soon after exposure, can help protect against illness, the state Department of Public Health said.

Many in the outbreak have developed bumps on their body.The vaccine, available to people who live or work in Massachusetts who also meet the CDC’s eligibility criteria, is being administered at three sites in Boston, two in Springfield, as well as in Provincetown, Randolph, Lawrence, Framingham, Worcester and New Bedford.
