WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Under-pressure All Blacks head coach Ian Foster has retained Beauden Barrett at flyhalf and made four personnel changes to his starting 15 for Saturday’s third and deciding test against Ireland.Barrett performed poorly in the All Blacks’ 23-12 second-test loss last weekend which allowed Ireland to level the three-match series. His inaccurate tactical kicking contributed to Ireland’s advantages of territory and possession which kept the All Blacks under pressure.Foster has given Barrett another chance, resisting any temptation to include Richie Mo’unga at No. 10 in the lineup he announced on Thursday. Barrett will again be marking Johnny Sexton, who will lead Ireland in his 108th test, equaling Paul O’Connell’s record of Irish test caps.Winger Will Jordan was picked in place of Leicester Fainga’anuku and David Havili at inside center to replace Quinn Tupaea. Sam Whitelock returns at lock after missing the second test with concussion symptoms and Scott Barrett again moves from lock to the blindside flank, where he played in the All Blacks’ first test win.ADVERTISEMENTWhitelock will start beside Brodie Retallick in a test for the 61st time.Foster included prop Nepo Laulala at tighthead in place of Ofa Tuungafasi, who received a yellow card and produced an ineffective performance at scrums in the second test.RugbyAustralia makes 4 changes, England 3 for series deciderRomania hooker Butnariu banned 3 weeks for red cardReport: Mistakes, not Liverpool fans, caused CL final fiascoWorld Rugby rankings reflect northern rise, southern slideVeteran hooker Dane Coles was included on the reserves bench along with former New Zealand Warriors rugby league captain Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, who is in line for an All Blacks test debut in midfield.Ireland, meanwhile, promoted New Zealand-born center Bundee Aki into its starting lineup in the only change to the XV that started in the second test.Aki replaced the injured Garry Ringrose at inside center in a new midfield partnership with Robbie Henshaw. Keith Earls moved into the squad to take Aki’s place on the bench. Aki joins two other New Zealand-born players in the Ireland backline — scrumhalf Jamison Gibson-Park and winger James Lowe.New Zealand coach Foster already is under pressure after the All Blacks’ first-ever home loss to Ireland last weekend and that pressure likely would become insurmountable if his team slumps to an unprecedented series defeat.New Zealand Rugby might have to act to allay public concern about the form and direction of the All Blacks just over a year out from the World Cup.Foster has maintained a positive outlook and mostly remained loyal to players involved in the second test. Nothing in his selection suggests a major change to the tactics which Ireland read and negated last weekend.“It’s tough having a loss but the tough weeks are often the most exciting,” Foster said. “A series decider against a high-quality side is a great occasion for our growth as a team.”___Lineups:New Zealand: Jordie Barrett, Will Jordan, Rieko Ioane, David Havili, Sevu Reece, Beauden Barrett, Aaron Smith; Ardie Savea, Sam Cane (captain), Scott Barrett, Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick, Nepo Laulala, Codie Taylor, George Bower.
