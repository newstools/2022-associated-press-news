COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka’s Central Bank has raised its key interest rates to 14.50% and 15.50% to try to contain inflation that has added to the country’s economic woes. Recent price hikes have been a severe blow, especially for the South Asian country’s poor and vulnerable groups as they endure their country’s worst economic crisis in memory, struggling with acute shortages of essentials such as food, fuel, cooking gas and medicines.The central bank said it had raised its Standing Deposit Facility Rate and Standing Lending Facility Rate that it charges commercial banks by 100 basis points each to 14.50% and 15.50%, respectively.The bank said it would need to tighten its monetary policy further to fully curb inflation, which rose to nearly 55% in June.“Our priority is to bring down inflation to at least a reasonable level as soon as possible. The sooner the better,” said the central bank governor, Nandalal Weerasinghe. He said inflation might surge to 70%.
