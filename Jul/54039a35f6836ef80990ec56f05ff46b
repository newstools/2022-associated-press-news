BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (AP) — Work to remove a dam on the Green River is on hold due to low water intake levels, officials said.Crews began removing Green River Lock and Dam No. 5 last September, but stopped work after Edmonson County Water District General Manager Tony Sanders expressed concern last week about water intake levels.The levels are about a foot lower than last year and if they drop another 1.5 feet, the issue could become critical, Sanders told the Daily News.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and The Nature Conservancy decided to temporarily halt dam removal until a permanent solution is reached on the issue.“Eventually that dam will be removed,” said David Phemister, state director for The Nature Conservancy. “But the partnership is not going to proceed on that until we have a solution to the satisfaction of all parties, until we’ve got an answer on the water supply.”The dam sat unused for 70 years before officials decided to remove it to open up 73 miles of free-flowing Green River for visitors and wildlife.
