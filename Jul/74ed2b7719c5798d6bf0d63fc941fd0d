NEW YORK (AP) — Two people were killed Saturday by police in separate shootings in New York City. The shootings occurred within about an hour of each other.Police said the first occurred in Queens at approximately 6:30 p.m. after a man made two 911 calls identifying himself and threatening police and public officials. Multiple officers approached the man’s residence and began firing after the man came outside and began firing at them, Chief Jeffrey Maddrey said. Six officers fired “probably north of 100 rounds” at the man, who was pronounced dead at a hospital. No officers were hit. Maddrey said the man had had previous contact with police and may have had mental health issues. The second shooting occurred in Brooklyn about an hour later. According to Maddrey, officers in an unmarked car pulled over a vehicle for traffic violations. During the stop, a man riding in the car fled down Flatbush Avenue and fired at a pursuing officer, who shot and killed him.
