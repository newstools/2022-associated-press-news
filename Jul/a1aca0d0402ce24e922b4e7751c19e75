WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Ireland leveled a series within a series when it beat New Zealand Maori 30-24 on Tuesday in the second of two matches between the teams on Ireland’s New Zealand tour.The Maori beat Ireland 32-17 two weeks ago in the leadup to the first test between Ireland and the All Blacks.With the test series at 1-1 after Ireland beat the All Blacks 23-12 in the second test on Saturday, the Ireland midweek team provided the test side with a confidence boost, winning on the same ground on which the deciding test will be played.The match was played in the immediate aftermath of a storm which swept Wellington on Tuesday, bringing high winds and heavy rains. Conditions moderated a little in time for the match but the slippery field and gusts still dictated the style of the match.Winger Jordan Larmour book-ended Ireland’s win with their first and last tries and also collected a yellow card in an eventful performance.ADVERTISEMENTThe Maori attempted to play their traditional running game but conditions were against them. Though they ran the ball from their own goal-line at times, a slippery ball forced handling errors which broke down their attacking game.Ireland, in contrast, made the conditions their friend, using an astute kicking game to win a vital territorial advantage. When they ran the ball it was mostly through close and careful passing, first among the forwards, then using dangerous attackers such as Larmour effectively closer to the line.RugbyItoje, Underhill out of England squad for decisive 3rd testNamibia qualifies for 2023 Rugby World CupGeorgia makes rugby history by beating Italy 28-19Rugby woes: things look black in All Black land after loss “It was very pleasing,” Ireland captain Keith Earls said. “At times we didn’t help ourselves.“In the first game our discipline was poor and we had a lot of young lads who just didn’t know how to play big boy rugby. Thankfully, we learned from a lot of mistakes and got the job done tonight.”The Maori opened the scoring with a try after only three minute to winger Shaun Stevenson — also a try-scorer in the first match — who took advantage of an overlap after a lineout win.Larmour scored five minutes later, again from a lineout after Earls took advantage of lax defense to put the winger into space.Ciaran Frawley nudged Ireland ahead with a penalty and Nick Timoney scored from a lineout drive to put the tourists ahead 17-5 at halftime.The Maori received a penalty try and Larmour a yellow card in the 45th minute for tackling a player without the ball when a try would have been scored. That cut Ireland’s lead to 20-12.Back-rower Gavin Coombes wrestled the ball over the line in the 67th to increase Ireland’s lead to 25-12.Replacement fullback Ruben Love scored one try and made another for the Maori late in the match but they were held at bay by Larmour’s second try. ___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
