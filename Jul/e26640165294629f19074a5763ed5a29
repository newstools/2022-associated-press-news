Porter was yellow-carded and Retallick was replaced. He’s out for up to eight weeks, missing the Rugby Championship.Ireland won 32-22 for a historic series win in New Zealand.Porter was cited after the game for a dangerous tackle. At his disciplinary hearing, he admitted to foul play but didn’t consider it a red card offense.The judiciary agreed on Tuesday, saying the foul “did not meet the red card threshold due to the absorbing nature of the tackle.”The citing was dismissed.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
