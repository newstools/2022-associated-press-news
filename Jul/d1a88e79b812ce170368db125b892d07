Attorney General Hector Balderas’s office later took over the case and upgraded the charge to second-degree murder. ADVERTISEMENTSmelser’s attorney, Amy L. Orlando, has previously said Smelser used the chokehold as part of his training and the murder charge was a headline-grabbing political move.Valenzuela’s death led to a $6.5 million settlement with his family as well as changes with Las Cruces police. These include banning all chokeholds and firing any officer who violates the new policy.
