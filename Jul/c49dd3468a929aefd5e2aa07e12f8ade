JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The state of Alaska plans to begin distributing this year’s oil-wealth fund check and a special energy relief payment to residents on Sept. 20.The timeline was announced Friday by Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state Department of Revenue.The combined payout for the dividend and energy relief payment is estimated to be around $3,200 per person; a final figure is pending. Residents will receive the money as one payment, the department said. The energy relief payment was intended by lawmakers as a one-time benefit to help residents with high energy costs.Most Alaskans get a dividend. There is a yearly application and residency requirements to qualify. Dividends traditionally have been paid using earnings from the state’s oil-wealth fund, the Alaska Permanent Fund. They are typically paid in the early fall.But Dunleavy said this year’s distribution will be a bit earlier. Checks will start going out to those who requested payments by direct deposit starting Sept. 20 and for those who filed a paper application or requested a paper check starting the week of Oct. 3, according to the Department of Revenue.The department said it was still in the process of determining eligibility for more than 78,000 applicants. Checks for last year’s dividend began going out the week of Oct. 11, 2021. Last year’s dividend was $1,114.
