BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) — England fast bowler Stuart Broad conceded 35 runs against a merciless Jasprit Bumrah in the most expensive over ever bowled in test cricket on Saturday.

The India captain took 29 runs off the over which also cost 5 wides and a no-ball.With the second new ball only three overs old, Bumrah top edged Broad for four off the first ball before another short delivery which went for 5 wides. Bumrah got a top-edged six off the third delivery which was signaled a no-ball and then followed it up with three successive boundaries, a six and a single off the last ball.The previous record of 28 runs in an over was jointly shared by Brian Lara of the West Indies, George Bailey of Australia and South African Keshav Maharaj.Bumrah finished on 31 not out as India was bowled out for 416 in its first innings with England 16-1 in reply at lunch.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
