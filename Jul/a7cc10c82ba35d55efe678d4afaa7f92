We’ve reached out to United for further clarification but have not heard back.”Barney Helmick, Pulliam’s airport director, said United flights out of Flagstaff were at 90% load capacity.“We will continue to stay in contact with United during 2022 in hopes we can re-establish service in 2023,” he added.ADVERTISEMENTHeidi Hansen, interim Deputy City Manager, said “the load percentages are incredible, but we can’t control pilot, crew, plane shortages or on time issues that are happening nationwide.”Airport officials said Pulliam had 105,000 passengers flying in and out of Flagstaff in the past year.American Airlines continues to offer daily flights from Flagstaff to Phoenix and Dallas/Fort Worth.
