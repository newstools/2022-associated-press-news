He is 1-0 with a 6.97 ERA with 11 strikeouts in 10 1/3 innings. Right-handers are hitting .222 against him.In 15 Triple-A appearances, he is 1-1 with a 6.06 ERA.Ramirez has pitched in 49 career major league games with Seattle (2020-22) and Cleveland, going 2-3 with five saves and a 3.99 ERA.“We really liked his stuff,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “I think there’s some things that we think mechanically we can continue to work on, but the actual stuff, we really like. The other thing is this is a guy with two options, which is really important for a club like us. We’re fortunate to get somebody like that.”ADVERTISEMENTNewman, 28, is batting .250 with no homers and eight RBIs in 14 games this season. He played shortstop before getting hurt but started at second base Friday.
