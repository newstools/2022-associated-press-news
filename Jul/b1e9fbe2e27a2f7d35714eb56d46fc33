ROLLA, N.D. (AP) — Sheriff’s officials say 700 animals have been seized in North Dakota following a complaint about neglect in Rolette County. Acting on an anonymous tip, sheriff’s deputies with assistance from the North Dakota Stockmen’s Association and the North Dakota State Veterinarian’s Office, went to a property in Rolette County armed with a search warrant early last month. In a Facebook post, the sheriff’s office says deputies found dead cattle and and an insufficient amount of feed for hundreds of other animals. The conditions of about 500 head of cattle were documented and instructions given to their owner on their well-being. Rolette County deputies continued to monitor the herd and returned late in June and determined the livestock, as well as 200 head of cattle owned by the same person in other counties, needed to be seized. The sheriffs office said it has contracted third-party individuals to care, feed and monitor the animals, which will be sold.
