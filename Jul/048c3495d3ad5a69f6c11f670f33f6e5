CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South Africa made 11 changes to its starting 15 on Tuesday and brought back captain Siya Kolisi and a string of other first-choice players for the series-deciding third test against Wales.Front-rowers Bongi Mbonambi and Frans Malherbe, lock Lood de Jager, loose forwards Kolisi and Jasper Wiese, and backs Makazole Mapimpi, Damian de Allende, Lukhanyo Am, Cheslin Kolbe and Damian Willemse were all recalled to start in Cape Town on Saturday.They returned after coach Jacques Nienaber rested them for the second test as he made wholesale changes to his starting lineup and paid for it as Wales leveled the series 1-1 with a 13-12 victory in Bloemfontein.The Springboks team for the decider is much closer to full strength, although backup scrumhalf Jaden Hendrikse was retained and will start at Cape Town Stadium ahead of regular No. 9 Faf de Klerk. Handré Pollard is at flyhalf.ADVERTISEMENTFlanker Pieter-Steph du Toit also starts again after making his return from injury in last weekend’s surprise loss, which was South Africa’s first at home to Wales. The defeat saw the world champion Springboks knocked off the top of the rugby world rankings.“We had an honest discussion with the players, telling them what we require from them this weekend and what we would like to see in terms of their performance,” Nienaber said, “and hopefully they can produce the goods and we can get the desired result.”RugbyAll Blacks prop Ta'avao banned 3 weeks for red cardItoje, Underhill out of England squad for decisive 3rd testNamibia qualifies for 2023 Rugby World CupGeorgia makes rugby history by beating Italy 28-19Lock Eben Etzebeth is set to play his 100th test and become the seventh South African to do so.
