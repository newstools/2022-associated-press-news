PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) — Thousands of thrill-seekers avoided getting gored Saturday during the bull run of Pamplona’s San Fermín Festival, officials said, revising an early report saying bull horns stabbed two men.Officials in the Spanish city officials corrected the preliminary report by Pamplona’s hospital to state that a man was scratched on the buttocks but not pierced by a horn. After the morning run through narrow streets ended, another man suffered a laceration when a wild cow was set loose in the city’s bullring for individuals to test their evasion maneuvers, according to the update.A total of seven men — six Spaniards and one Frenchman— needed to be treated at the hospital, according to authorities. None of the injuries appeared serious.While it turned out no one was skewered, the main event produced close calls for the human runners. Some of the massive bulls opted to knock aside people in their path instead of running them through with a potentially deadly horn.ADVERTISEMENTSeveral runners were stomped or bowled over by the half-dozen bulls and the six tame oxen that help guide them along the 875-meter (956-yard) course through Pamplona’s old quarter.There were no gorings on the first two days of this year’s festival either.
