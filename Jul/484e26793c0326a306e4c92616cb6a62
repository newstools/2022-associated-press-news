GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Bangladesh swept the one-day international series in the Caribbean by winning the third match against a depleted West Indies bowling attack by four wickets on Saturday.Bangladesh was favored to win an 11th consecutive ODI against the West Indies, especially after bowling out the home side in the 49th over for 178, its best total of the series.The West Indies was handicapped further when allrounder Keemo Paul pulled a hamstring and didn’t bowl, and part-time medium-pacer Rovman Powell suffered a side strain after delivering 11 balls.The West Indies used seven bowlers, but after spinner Gudakesh Motie-Kanhai used up his 10 overs for a team-best 4-23, Bangladesh strolled to the win at 179-6 with nine balls to spare.While Bangladesh respected Motie-Kanhai, who claimed captain Tamim Iqbal, caught and bowled Liton Das, bowled Afif Hossain and Mosaddek Hossain, the batters comfortably took runs off everyone else.ADVERTISEMENTTamim got 34 before miscuing a sweep to fine leg and Liton pushed the scoring with 50 off 65 balls.Mosaddek charged Motie-Kanhai and hit straight to the long off fielder to leave Bangladesh on a worrying 116-5. But Motie-Kanhai was finished, and Mahmudullah, 26, and Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 16 not out, stayed calm and collected the runs.CricketJayasuriya's five-for has Pakistan in trouble in 1st testSydney Cricket Ground set for Wallabies-England deciderZimbabwe, Netherlands qualify for T20 World CupManchester United begins Australian tour with 4-1 winBangladesh made one inspired change from the second ODI, giving spinner Taijul Islam his first international match on the tour ahead of pacer Shoriful Islam.
