SEATTLE (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday made two more nominations for the federal bench in western Washington state: Seattle lawyers Jamal Whitehead and Kymberly Evanson.Whitehead is a civil litigator with the firm Schroeter Goldmark & Bender, where he focuses on workplace discrimination and unfair labor practices.He recently represented a class of immigration detainees at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma who successfully sued the private prison contractor The GEO Group for back pay, arguing that they should have been granted the minimum wage for cooking, cleaning and other tasks they performed. A federal jury ordered GEO to pay $17.3 million to more than 10,000 current and former detainees.Whitehead, who is Black and who uses a prosthetic leg, is Biden’s first disabled nominee to the federal bench, said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who recommended him and Evanson. Biden has emphasized racial, cultural and professional diversity in his court nominations.ADVERTISEMENT“Our federal bench should be filled with judges who are committed to justice and who reflect the diversity of the communities they serve — which is why I am thrilled for Jamal, his family, and the Western District of Washington state,” Murray said in a news release.Joe BidenThe Latest: Biden seeking to ‘integrate’ Israel into MideastTrump, Hogan fight emerges in Maryland's GOP governor's raceIsraeli politics a chaotic backdrop for Biden's visitMan charged with rape of girl, 10, who traveled for abortionEvanson is a partner at Pacifica Law Group.
