WIMBLEDON, England (AP) — Wimbledon quarterfinalist Nick Kyrgios is due in court back home in Australia next month, and a lawyer representing him said Tuesday the “precise nature of” the allegations “is neither certain at this moment nor confirmed by either the prosecution or” the 27-year-old professional tennis player.Kyrgios practiced at the All England Club on Tuesday, and the All England Club confirmed he is scheduled to play his match against Cristian Garin of Chile on Wednesday.“While Mr. Kyrgios is committed to addressing any and all allegations once clear, taking the matter seriously does not warrant any misreading of the process Mr. Kyrgios is required to follow,” attorney Pierre Johannessen wrote in a statement emailed to the media.Johannessen wrote that “the allegations are not considered as fact” by the court, and Kyrgios is not “considered charged” with an offense until a first appearance in court.ADVERTISEMENTWednesday’s match against Garin is the third Grand Slam quarterfinal of the Australian’s career — he is 0-2 in the others — and first in 7 1/2 years.“We have been made aware of legal proceedings involving Nick Kyrgios in Australia, and as they are ongoing, we are not in a position to offer a comment,” an All England Club spokesperson said Tuesday. “We are in touch with Nick’s team and he remains scheduled to play his quarterfinal match tomorrow.”WimbledonWimbledon lookahead: Djokovic, Jabeur play on Centre CourtWimbledon's all-white clothing bothers some, delights othersWimbledon updates | Ons Jabeur advances to 1st GS semifinalAP PHOTOS: The 1st week at the Wimbledon tennis tournamentThe Canberra Times reported that Kyrgios is supposed to appear in court on Aug. 2.
