BATON ROUGE, lA. (AP) — Louisiana authorities are investigating a case of vandalism at a women’s clinic that discourages abortion.Baton Rouge news outlets say police were called to the Women’s New Life Clinic Tuesday morning.Photos from the scene show streaks of red paint covering signs outside the clinic. The words “Fake Clinic” were painted on the door and “abortion is a right” on one window. No arrests have been made.Louisiana law banning most abortions was designed to take effect immediately upon the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision reversing abortion rights. But enforcement of the law is currently blocked by a state court’s temporary order. The clinic’s website lists an array of services including pregnancy testing, ultrasounds and gynecological care. It also offers “abortion pill reversal” — a controversial practice involving administering the drug progesterone to a woman who has taken the first of two drugs to induce a chemical abortion.
