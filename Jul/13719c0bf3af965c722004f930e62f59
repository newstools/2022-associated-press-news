Belarusian clubs BATE Borisov, Gomel, Shakhtyor Soligorsk and Dinamo Minsk are potential opponents.Cologne said it was “ asking UEFA to take decisive action and to remove the teams from the competition ” because of “the political situation and the support for Russia from the Belarusian government in the invasion of Ukraine.”The club said it strongly condemned “the openly communicated closeness of the Belarusian government to Russia as well as the behavior associated with the war in Ukraine” and it encouraged its members to support its appeal for the clubs to be excluded.ADVERTISEMENTBelarus is a close ally of Russia and has allowed the country’s forces to use its territory to attack Ukraine.
