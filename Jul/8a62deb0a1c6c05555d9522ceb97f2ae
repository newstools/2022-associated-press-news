He brought up his 23rd half-century with a single to covers off Naseem Shah.Chandimal closed the day with five fours and two sixes from 121 deliveries. Prabath Jayasuriya was on four.The 32-year-old Chandimal has been in good nick having posted a maiden double hundred against Australia last week as Sri Lanka went onto record a come from behind against the world’s top-ranked team.ADVERTISEMENTPakistan had an opportunity to dismiss Chandimal when he was on 68 but Hasan Ali put down a return catch. Pakistan also unsuccessfully reviewed a leg-before shout against him.The game was evenly poised when the day began with Sri Lanka having a lead of 40 runs with nine wickets in hand. Pakistan knocked off night-watchman Kasun Rajitha early in the second over of the morning but a 91-run stand for the third wicket between Kusal Mendis (76) and Oshada Fernando (64) steadied the innings.CricketStokes retires from ODIs because of 'unsustainable' scheduleSri Lanka switches venues for 2nd cricket test vs PakistanCummins rested for Australia's series against Zimbabwe, NZHolder back in West Indies squad to play India in ODI seriesHowever, after lunch, Pakistan claimed a few quick wickets to bounce back.Yasir Shah dismissed Kusal Mendis with a ball that pitched well outside the leg-stump and then turned sharply and knocked top of off-stump beating the batsman’s defence.
