BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) — Ravindra Jadeja got his first overseas test hundred and Stuart Broad bowled the most expensive over in test cricket history as India was finally dismissed for 416 on the second day of the series-deciding test against England on Saturday.England lost opener Alex Lees (6) just before rain arrived at Edgbaston for the second successive day in the morning session of the fifth test and the home team reached 16-1 at an early lunch in its first innings. India leads the delayed series 2-1.Jasprit Bumrah (31 not out) first celebrated his test captaincy debut by clubbing Broad for four boundaries and two sixes in one over which ultimately went for a world record 35 runs. Bumrah, who scored 29 runs off the bat in Broad’s over which also included 5 wides and a no-ball, then knocked back the stumps of Lees while bowling around the wicket. The ball nipped back into the left-hander and went through his defenses.ADVERTISEMENTEarlier, resuming on 338-7, India added another rapid 78 runs in an hour with Jadeja getting to his well-deserved century before getting out for 104. The left-hander, resuming on 83, edged fast bowler Matthew Potts (2-105) through the slips for four and then followed it up with a square cut to point boundary to raise his impressive century off 183 balls.CricketBroad bowls most expensive over in test cricket historyAustralia spins out Sri Lanka to win 1st test by 10 wicketsAustralia beats Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in 1st cricket testSri Lankan Mathews has COVID-19 during 1st cricket testJadeja batted in the shadow of Rishabh Pant’s combative knock of 146 off 111 balls on the first day which lifted India from a precarious 98-5 as both left-handers shared a fabulous 222-run aggressive partnership for the sixth wicket.Broad (1-89) finally had his first wicket of the innings when Mohammed Shami was caught by Jack Leach.James Anderson picked up his 32nd five-wicket haul in test cricket when he had the last two wickets to finish with 5-60.Jadeja, who hit 13 boundaries, ambitiously swung his bat against Anderson and was clean bowled while Mohammed Siraj was caught at mid-on by Broad.
