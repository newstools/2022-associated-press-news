Out of consideration for Bud, we ask that you please respect his privacy at this time.”Montoyo and Budzinski had a brief huddle with the coaching staff before leaving the dugout. Bench coach John Schneider replaced Montoyo and bullpen catcher Luis Hurtado coached first.Budzinski played four games for Cincinnati in 2003 and retired in 2005.
