The 33-year-old star scored 37 tries in 73 test for Australia before returning to rugby league amid controversy over homophobic social media posts.Folau played for the Catalan Dragons in the European Super League before switching back to rugby with the Shining Arcs in the Japan professional competition this year. Changes in World Rugby eligibility rules allowed him to return to test rugby Saturday and he did so among nine players making their debut for Tonga.Folau left the field with a leg injury in the 27th minute and was replaced by Tima Fainga’anuku who made his debut for Tonga on the same day his brother Leicester was due to make his test debut for New Zealand against Ireland. The former All Black Charles Piutau, reportedly one of the highest-paid players in British rugby, also made his debut for Tonga on Saturday.ADVERTISEMENTThat fire power wasn’t enough to hold out Fiji who were playing a test at home for the first time in almost three years.RugbyBig 2nd half helps France top Japan 42-23 in 1st testItaly on three-win streak after beating Romania 45-13No big surprise: England rugby coach Jones in spotlightJapan looks to Rugby World Cup preparation against FranceFiji made an explosive start scoring three tries to lead 19-0 after only 24 minutes.
