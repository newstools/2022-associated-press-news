HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A dispute about state funding for the University of Pittsburgh over its use of fetal tissue from elective abortions in research ended quietly Thursday when lawmakers approved the annual subsidy.The Senate passed it 43-7 together with funding for the other three state-related universities — Penn State, Lincoln and Temple. Pitt is in line to receive $155 million in the current year.House Republicans had sought a provision that would require a university financial officer to submit a sworn statement attesting that their school does not use such tissue in order to get state funding.Pitt last year commissioned an independent review of its fetal tissue research practice that found that the university was not influencing people to terminate pregnancies and there was no illegal arrangement between the university and Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania.To resolve the legislative dispute, the provision regarding fetal tissue research was added to a separate bill in the House late Wednesday. That bill is still pending.Together, the schools will receive more than $597 million from the state government. They are not state-owned.
