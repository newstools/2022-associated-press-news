The missing passengers are feared dead. Their relatives are still waiting hopefully along the riverbank to witness the rescue operation.Assi said at least 90 people were on board the boat when the boat capsized.Such accidents are common in Pakistan, where rickety wooden boats are often used to transport goods and people on rivers and lakes. Most operate without life jackets.
