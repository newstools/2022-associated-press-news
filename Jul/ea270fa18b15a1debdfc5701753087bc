HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Democrats and Republicans called Wednesday for special hearings to be held on proposed double-digit rate increases being sought by nine health insurers that offer coverage on and off the state’s Access Health CT exchange.Connecticut’s Department of Insurance is planning to hold an informational public hearing on the requested rate increases in early August and accept written comments. But Democratic Attorney General William Tong said he wants a “formal hearing” at which expert witness would be called to testify and insurance industry representatives would be questioned under oath about why they need such a large rate increase.The insurers are seeking average rate increases of 20.4% for the individual market, and 14.8% for small groups.“Yes, I want to litigate this question because the people of this state deserve nothing less than that,” Tong said during a news conference with other state officials and advocates. He called the insurance department’s informational hearing “pretty loose and informal.”ADVERTISEMENTRepublican leaders in the Connecticut General Assembly, meanwhile, called on the state’s insurance commissioner this week to hold a public hearing in the state Capitol complex on the proposed rate increases.

He said the agency is “fully committed to consumer protection and transparency,” noting the hearings are open to the public and aired on the public affairs CT-N Network. Also, the proposed rate increases, which go through an actuarial review by the state department, are posted on the agency’s website.
