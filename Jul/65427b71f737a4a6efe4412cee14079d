Obviously, each person decides how to open up and how much,” Kasatkina said.Soon after the interview was released, Kasatkina posted a picture on Instagram of her embracing Olympic silver medalist figure skater Natalia Zabiiako with a heart emoji and called Zabiiako “my cutie pie” in a Twitter post. Zabiiako, who won her Olympic medal with the Russian team in 2018, posted the same picture on Instagram, also with a heart.

In the interview, she also calls for an end to fighting in Ukraine.“For the war to end,” Kasatkina said when asked what she wants most in life, and describes the conflict as a “complete nightmare.” Russian authorities insist that the conflict is not referred to as a “war,” but a “special military operation,” and criticism of the war or the Russian military can be punished with fines or prison time. Kasatkina is shown in the video crying when asked if she fears she may not be able to return to Russia after her comments in the interview.___More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
