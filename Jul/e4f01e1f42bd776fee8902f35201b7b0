Matt Spillane said none of those wounded in the shooting Saturday evening in a residential neighborhood have life-threatening injuries.Spillane said the officers returned fire after being shot at while responding to a report of gunshots at the home around 6:45 p.m. One officer was hit in both legs, and the other two were shot in the arm. The suspect died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. He said the Texas Rangers — the state’s elite police force — would take over the investigation. A motive for the shooting was not immediately clear. Authorities have not released the names of any of the people involved in the attack.“The main focus is on how and why this happened,” Spillane told The Associated Press.ADVERTISEMENTA woman was found dead inside a house and a man was found dead outside, Sgt. Rick Alexander said , speaking at a news conference late Saturday.
