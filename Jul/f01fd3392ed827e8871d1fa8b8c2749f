Two-time Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah of Jamaica was the favorite in the 100 and many thought she had a decent chance to break the 34-year-old record of 10.49 seconds held by Florence Griffith-Joyner. The last time Thompson-Herah ran a final at Hayward was two weeks after the Tokyo Olympics at Prefontaine Classic. She clocked at 10.54 and joined Flo Jo as the only woman to break 10.6.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
