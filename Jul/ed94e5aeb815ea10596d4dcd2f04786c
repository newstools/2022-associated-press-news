BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Eddie Jones is seeing red. And yellow. They’re referee’s penalty cards, and the outspoken England coach says he’s seeing far too many of them in rugby.Jones took a few minutes after England’s series-equaling 25-17 win over the Wallabies on Saturday to criticize the game’s laws, adding it’s “out of control.”Australia winger Izaia Perese and England flyhalf Marcus Smith were yellow-carded for what were deemed deliberate knockdowns.But Jones said neither player deserved to be sin-binned because they were attempting to make a clean catch and the law to determine a deliberate knockdown “doesn’t make any sense.”Jones also mentioned the New Zealand-Ireland test on Saturday in Dunedin, where the All Blacks received two yellow cards and a contentious red in their 23-12 loss which also evened that series.“At one stage, commentators couldn’t count how many players were on the field, you had three backs packing a scrum,” Jones said of the match in Dunedin. “We’ve gone the full hog where everything’s a red card, yellow card, and there needs to be some common sense.”ADVERTISEMENTAnd then Jones being Jones, he added: “I picked the referee’s pocket (before the game), he had plenty of cards in it.”RugbyRugby woes: things look black in All Black land after lossEngland edges Australia in 2nd test, levels 3-match seriesFrance scores late to beat Japan 20-15 in 2nd testIreland beat New Zealand 23-12, level 3-match series at 1-1The win gave Jones a chance to admonish the media over questions about his future as coach after the opening loss in Perth last week.“I love it,” he said of the speculation about his job ahead of next year’s Rugby World Cup in France. “It’s fantastic. I love my mother ringing me up in the morning, saying, ‘Are you getting sacked, when are you getting sacked?’“But I don’t mind. I made the choice to take the job and there’s an infatuation with sacking coaches now. It’s neither here nor there for me, but I love coaching at Suncorp.”And well he should love the Brisbane stadium, formerly Lang Park — he’s won all seven tests he’s coached there, either formerly with the Wallabies or England.“Forty-eight thousand people, all full of drink that want to see their team when,” Jones said. “When you turn them away it’s a great feeling.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
