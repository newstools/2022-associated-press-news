Unvaccinated baseball players are placed on the restricted list, which means they are not paid and do not accrue major league service time.Among the 10 players on Kansas City’s 26-man roster who stayed home were All-Star outfielder Andrew Benintendi, two-time All-Star Whit Merrifield, future cornerstones Kyle Isbel and MJ Melendez and outfielder Michael A. Taylor.ADVERTISEMENTAlso barred were first baseman Hunter Dozier, right-handed starters Brad Keller and Brady Singer, reliever Dylan Coleman and backup catcher Cam Gallagher.“We just abide by the rules that are given to us,” manager Mike Matheny said before the game. “It’s not how we’d design it but it is where we are and now we move forward.”MLBRays score five in 7th, beat Boston 5-4 for four-game sweepWright ties majors wins lead as Braves defeat Nationals, 5-4McKenzie whiffs 12 in 8 scoreless, Guardians trip Tigers 4-0HR Derby matchups set: Top-seeded Schwarber vs PujolsThe Royals recalled infielder Nick Pratto and selected Eaton, infielder Michael Massey, catcher Freddy Fermin and outfielder Brewer Hicklen from Triple-A Omaha.
