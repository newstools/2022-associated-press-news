CAIRO (AP) — Egypt on Wednesday increased the price of its widely used diesel and other fuels in a move expected to further drive up prices of other goods and services. The country, like others, faces steep inflationary pressures in the wake of Russia’s war on Ukraine.In a statement, the country’s petroleum ministry said it would increase prices immediately. The price for a liter of diesel has been hiked from 6.75 Egyptian pounds (.36 USD) a liter to 7.25 Egyptian pounds (.38 USD), an increase of 7.4%. Other types of gasoline saw hikes of the same amount, with higher octane gasoline being hiked by 1 Egyptian pound, or 5 U.S. cents per liter.The move is expected to exacerbate economic pressures on the country’s poor and the middle class which have been hit hard in recent years by austerity measures dictated by the government’s ambitious economic restructuring program.Already on Wednesday, transport authorities in Cairo, the country’s capital, announced that fares for various modes of transport, including trains, subway and taxis, would increase between 5% and 7%.ADVERTISEMENTThe reform program has in recent years included steep price hikes for fuel, drinking water and electricity as part of austerity measures designed to overhaul a significantly subsidized economy, still recovering from years of turmoil following its 2011 popular uprising.InflationUS inflation reached a new 40-year high in June of 9.1%Release of latest US inflation data sends markets tumblingEurope as a budget-friendly travel option?
