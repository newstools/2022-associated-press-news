LONDON (AP) — The record numbers of fans at the Women’s European Championship have been treated to a star showing from host side England, even as they’ve had to contend with a record-breaking heatwave.The rest day Tuesday between the end of the group stage and England playing Spain in the first of the quarterfinals fortunately coincided with the worst of the heat, set to hit a never-before-seen 40 degrees (104 F). That has brought health warnings, as well as widespread disruption to trains and flights.The last games of the group stage introduced cooling breaks midway through each half, a measure rarely needed for games in northern Europe.ENGLAND’S STRONG STARTThe host team has a good shot of winning its first major women’s soccer tournament, a status underlined by its 8-0 demolition of Norway.England had the best record of any team in the group stage — maximum points, 14 goals scored and none conceded — and Beth Mead is the tournament scoring leader with five goals and three assists.ADVERTISEMENTAfter opening with a tense 1-0 win over Austria, England was sharp and aggressive from the start to overwhelm a Norway containing two of the world’s top forwards in Ada Hegerberg and Caroline Graham Hansen. After coach Sarina Wiegman was sidelined with a positive coronavirus test, England beat Northern Ireland 5-0.

Around half of the 16 teams at the championship have had virus cases. Germany coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg in particular has been fiercely critical of UEFA’s refusal to expand squads from 23 to 26 players to deal with virus cases, as it did for the men’s European Championship last year.GERMANY’S REVIVALGermany was once the undisputed superpower of women’s soccer in Europe, winning eight of nine European Championships from 1989 through 2013. Since its last major title at the 2016 Olympics, however, Germany has not got past the quarterfinals of any tournament and its best clubs have been outgunned financially by the rising powers in England and Spain.ADVERTISEMENTEuro 2022 could mark a German revival.
