WEST GLACIER, Mont. (AP) — The scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park opened for the 2022 summer season on Wednesday after a spring marked by heavy snow and cool temperatures delayed plowing and maintenance work, park officials said.The July 13 opening matches the road’s latest opening dates since it first opened to the public on July 15, 1933.The alpine highway also opened on July 13 in 2011 due to a late snowpack and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Vehicle reservations are needed to travel on Going-to-the-Sun Road and can be obtained at the recreation.gov website. The $2 timed entry reservation fee is in addition to the $35 per vehicle park entry fee. Timed reservations are also needed to enter the North Fork area, but they are not needed to enter other parts of the park such as Many Glacier, Two Medicine, St. Mary or the Chief Mountain Highway.The park’s free shuttle service along Going-to-the-Sun Road operates on a first-come, first-served basis.
