(AP Photo/Ron Schwane)CLEVELAND (AP) — Cleveland Guardians star third baseman José Ramírez will undergo X-rays and other tests on his right shin after being injured during an at-bat in Thursday’s 4-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds.Ramírez collapsed in pain after fouling a ball off his shin in the eighth inning. After going down, he rolled onto his back in the dirt near home plate, and the 29-year-old Ramírez needed several minutes to recover. He then hobbled back into the batter’s box and promptly hit a single for his 34th RBI.Ramírez was pulled for a pinch-runner after the hit.Guardians manager Terry Francona said Ramírez, one of baseball’s best all-around players, will have his leg checked for any serious damage.“He’s pretty sore,” Francona said. “Hit above his (protective) pad, just below his knee. For him to react like that, he’s a pretty tough kid. He’s going to get some X-rays, but he’s sore.”Ramírez has been in a slump of late, but he’s still the biggest threat in Cleveland’s lineup and the Guardians can’t afford to be without him for too long.ADVERTISEMENTIt’s possible he could miss a game or two, dependent on the X-ray results.Ramírez signed a seven-year, $141 million contract extension with Cleveland on the eve of opening day.MLBAlonso's HR in 10th lifts Mets past Cardinals 7-6Mets ace Scherzer likely out 6 to 8 weeks for oblique strainAfter Mets lose Scherzer, Alonso HR in 10th beats Cards 7-6Robert homers, drives in 4 as White Sox beat Royals 7-4Meanwhile, Francona, who just returned to the team after being out with COVID-19, will miss Friday’s series opener against Detroit to have a minor surgical procedure.
