CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — The finishing touches on a six-lane upgrade of the West Virginia Turnpike in Beckley are getting underway and expected to last about eight weeks.The $140 million widening project on the eight-mile stretch was finished last fall, but final paving and striping were delayed to allow holiday traffic to have full access on the heavily traveled road.Paving and striping will take place between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. to minimize impact on motorists, said Jeff Miller, executive director of the West Virginia Parkways Authority. Delays should be expected until the work is complete.The speed limit in the zone will be 55 mph, the state Department of Transportation said. Miller said it will be strictly enforced.“It’s a very, very busy area, and we just don’t want anything bad to happen to anybody,” he said.
