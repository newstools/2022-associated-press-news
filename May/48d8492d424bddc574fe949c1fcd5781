I was a bit sad about what happened with the champagne but when I come back to the hotel they were super happy also.ADVERTISEMENT“They were a bit afraid but when I looked OK we really enjoyed. But today luckily I didn’t start the race because still my eyes, I need some rest to give more power to the eye … I’m OK now, see you soon.”In March, Girmay became the first rider from a sub-Saharan country to win a single-day classic at the Gent-Wevelgem race.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
