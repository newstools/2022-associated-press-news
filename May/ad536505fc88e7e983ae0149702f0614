Goosen hit 6-iron to 12 feet on the final hole. He ran his first putt 2 feet by the hole, then missed badly to the right. He had to make a 3-footer for a 71 to get into the playoff with Mark Brooks. Stewart Cink was tied for the lead playing the final hole until missing the green long, chipping to 15 feet and missing his par putt. Trying to get out of Goosen’s way, Cink missed the 18-inch bogey putt and wound up one shot out of the playoff. Goosen easily won the 18-hole playoff behind a four-shot swing in two holes, making birdies on the ninth and 10th while Brooks took bogeys. Tiger Woods tied for 12th, ending his run of winning four straight majors.2007 PGA CHAMPIONSHIPWinner: Tiger WoodsScore: 272Runner-up: Woody AustinMargin of victory: Two shots.Summary: Tiger Woods had a 15-foot birdie putt for a record 62 in the second round, only for the ball to spin around the cup and leave him his best score in a major.

He led by three going into the final round and staved off a late charge by Woody Austin with a 10-foot birdie putt on the 15th hole. Woods captured his 13th major at age 31; Jack Nicklaus was 35 when he won his 13th major.
