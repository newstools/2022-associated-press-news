HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The Connecticut Senate is expected to vote Tuesday evening on a revised, one-year $24.2 billion state budget that cleared the House of Representatives in the early morning with only Democratic votes.Despite Democrats lauding the package as historic for cutting taxes by an estimated $600 million, no Republicans in the House voted for the deal negotiated between Democratic leaders of the General Assembly and Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. The GOP argued the plan fell far short, given the state’s large projected surplus, and should have made systemic changes to Connecticut’s tax system.“This is a budget that’s crafted for November,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, referring to the upcoming election. “Republicans wanted a budget that’s crafted for the future.” But Democrats argued the plan will help taxpayers, both in the short and long term.ADVERTISEMENTThe list of tax changes includes continuation of the 25 cent-per-gallon gas tax cut until Dec. 1; creation of a new, one-year $250 child care tax credit; the accelerated phase-out of taxes on pension, annuity and 401K income by 2024; a lower limit on local car taxes that applies to 75 communities; and an increased local property tax credit against the personal income tax, from $200 to $300, that applies to more taxpayers.BusinessSlovakia, Hungary won't back EU sanctions on Russian energy Fed to fight inflation with fastest rate hikes in decadesEXPLAINER: What's the latest in Russia's dance with default?Employers post record 11.5 million job openings in MarchHouse Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he was surprised none of the GOP members in the House voted for the budget, which also includes more money for child care, children’s mental health and workforce development. He predicted those no votes will become part of the upcoming election. “We will, in competitive districts, point out what they voted against,” Ritter said.
