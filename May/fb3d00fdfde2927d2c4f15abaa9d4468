WASHINGTON (AP) — Demonstrators facing down a Supreme Court decision that could overturn women’s right to an abortion planned rallies from coast to coast Saturday to express their outrage – and to mobilize for the fight ahead.More than 380 events were planned from Maine to Hawaii, with the largest gatherings in big cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City, organizers said. In Washington, D.C., activists planned to gather at the Washington Monument before marching to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is now surrounded by a security fence.Tens of thousands of people were expected at the “Bans off our Bodies” events, providing an outlet for anger and frustration for abortion rights activists after a  leaked draft Supreme Court ruling suggested Roe v. Wade will be overturned.“If it’s a fight they want, it’s a fight they’ll get,” said Rachel Carmona, executive director of the Women’s March.ADVERTISEMENTPolls show that most Americans want to preserve access to abortion — at least in the earlier stages of pregnancy — but the Supreme Court appeared to be poised to let the states have the final say.If that happens, roughly half of states, mostly in the South and Midwest, are expected to quickly ban abortion.AbortionClarence Thomas says abortion leak has changed Supreme CourtCalifornia governor: $98B surplus backs true pro-life stateSome Catholic abortion foes are uneasy about overturning RoeNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekThe upcoming ruling stands to energize voters, potentially shaping the upcoming midterm election s.Saturday’s rallies were being held three days after the U.S. Senate failed to muster enough votes to codify Roe v.
