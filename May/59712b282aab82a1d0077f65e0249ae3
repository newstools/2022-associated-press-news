PARIS (AP) — Wissam Ben Yedder’s rapid hat trick helped Monaco rally from 2-0 down to beat Brest 4-2 for a ninth straight French league win on Saturday and move above Marseille into second place and the automatic Champions League place.Brest went 2-0 up midway through the first half, but Ben Yedder scored a penalty just before the interval. The France forward then netted in the 51st minute with a fine solo goal and a sharp header in the 55th. He has nine goals in the past nine games, and his strike partner Kevin Volland made it 4-2 in the 70th after Ben Yedder’s volley was saved.With one round remaining, Monaco and Marseille are level on points. Monaco has a better goal difference than Marseille, which was soundly beaten at Rennes 2-0. That lifted Rennes into fourth spot and automatic entry into the Europa League.Ben Yedder’s prolific season took him to 24 league goals, one less than top scorer Kylian Mbappe, who netted a second-half penalty as French champion Paris Saint-Germain won at Montpellier 4-0.ADVERTISEMENTLionel Messi scored the first two and Argentina teammate Angel Di Maria got the third, all in the first half.CHASING EUROPENice was once among the contenders for a Champions League place but its recent form has dipped and coach Christophe Galtier’s side was sixth after losing at home to Lille, last season’s champion, 3-1.SoccerMATCHDAY: Man City on brink; AC Milan can take Serie A Rapids up home streak to 22 with 2-0 victory over LAFCKyle Smith scores in 92nd, Orlando City beats Toronto FC 1-0Salernitana rescues 1-1 draw at Empoli, Venezia relegatedRELEGATION FIGHTSix-time champion Bordeaux was almost relegated after drawing with Lorient 0-0.
