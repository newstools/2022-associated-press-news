BUENOS AIRES (AP) — A flying museum in honor of soccer great Diego Maradona is set to take to the skies.The “Tango D10S” plane was introduced Wednesday night before it flies around Argentina for fans of Maradona to visit on the ground. The plane’s exterior is adorned with images of Maradona — who died in 2020 of a heart attack at the age of 60 after having brain surgery — including one where he wears the Argentina jersey and kisses the World Cup trophy he lifted in 1986.The plane will also visit Barcelona and Naples, where Maradona led Napoli to its only two Italian league titles in 1987 and 1990. Qatar, which hosts the World Cup later this year, will be the aircraft’s final stop in the tour.England fans may not want to visit wherever it goes. Drawings on the wings make reference to the two goals Maradona scored in the quarterfinals against England in the 1986 World Cup — the controversial “Hand of God” goal followed by a sublime individual effort waltzing through the England team. ADVERTISEMENTInside the plane, there are memorabilia items that belonged to Maradona.The plane, owned by a fintech company, was on display at El Palomar airport outside Buenos Aires, with Maradona’s family and some former Argentina teammates among those attending the ceremony.SoccerVinícius and Rodrygo get 1st shot at Champions League gloryNew York Red Bulls face D.C.

Visitors will have the chance to ask some previously selected questions to a Maradona hologram.“When you are here in Argentina you can’t realize what Diego means to the rest of the world,” said Sergio Batista, a former teammate. “It is a beautiful tribute that the entire world will experience, the world loved him.” ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
