MUMBAI, India (AP) — Devon Conway smashed his third straight half century and Moeen Ali picked up 3-13 as Chennai Super Kings registered an emphatic 91-run victory against Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League on Sunday.Earlier, leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga grabbed 5-18 and led Royal Challengers Bangalore to a 67-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad.Conway’s blistering 87 off 49 balls gave Chennai an impressive total of 208-6 with his opening partner Ruturaj Gaikwad making 41. Both openers took charge against spinners and fast bowlers as they combined in a blazing 110-run stand in 11 overs and laid a solid foundation for a big total.Delhi, which had chosen to bat second, stumbled to 117 all out with more than two overs left as Dwayne Bravo claimed the last two wickets off successive deliveries.Moeen had wrecked Delhi’s middle-order with the wickets of Mitchell Marsh (25) and Rishabh Pant (21) soon after the batting powerplay before fast bowler Mukesh Chaudhary took two wickets to reduce Delhi to 99-8.ADVERTISEMENTShardul Thakur delayed the inevitable by scoring 24 before he was caught behind off Bravo in the 18th over as Delhi was destroyed by some disciplined Chennai bowling.CricketStokes hits 17 sixes in comeback matchSams bowls standout last over for Mumbai to edge GujaratEnglish cricket team Essex fined for racism by officialNew Zealand picks Patel in 20-man squad for England tourWith three league games to go for both teams, Delhi has 10 points and is at No. 5 while Chennai is eighth with eight points.BANGALORE BEATS HYDERABADBangalore won the toss and scored 192-3.
