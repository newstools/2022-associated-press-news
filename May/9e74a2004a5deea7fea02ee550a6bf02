TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares slipped Monday lower following a sell-off last week on Wall Street as investors fretted over the impact on regional economies from inflation, the war in Ukraine and COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Benchmarks declined in Japan, South Korea and Australia. Trading was closed for holidays in China and many other regional markets. A report showing pandemic lockdowns have hurt factory activity in China, a main regional driver of growth, was a fresh source of concern. The monthly purchasing managers’ index, released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics, fell to 47.4 in April, down from 49.5 in March on a 100-point scale. Numbers below 50 show activity contracting.The COVID-19 outbreaks have impacted China’s factory activities and market demand, said the bureau’s statistician Zhao Qinghe.ADVERTISEMENTSome enterprises have reduced or stopped production, with disruptions in logistics as well as the supply or raw materials and components.

The capital, Beijing, began mass testing millions of residents this week. In Japan, a series of national holidays this week known as Golden Week is allowing people to take a vacation, even in the “workaholic” culture at companies. But the crowds gathering in resorts are adding to concerns coronavirus cases might pick up again, leading to a resumption of restrictions on restaurant opening hours and other business activities.

The Nasdaq composite, heavily weighted with technology stocks, has lost 21.2% this year. Traders are watching for next steps by the U.S. Federal Reserve to battle inflation. The Fed is expected to announce another round of rate hikes this week. That means higher borrowing costs at a time when inflation worries are high on the minds of investors and consumers alike. Prices for everything from food to gas have been rising as the economy recovers from the pandemic and there has been a big disconnect between higher demand and lagging supplies. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only added to inflation worries. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 92 cents to $103.77 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
