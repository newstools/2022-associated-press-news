BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont City Marathon and Relay returned to Burlington on Sunday, after being cancelled or shortened the last three years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The race started at Battery Park. To prevent a crowded start, there were waves of marathoners taking off at different times and they looped the half marathon course twice, the Burlington Free Press reported.More than 2,300 runners signed up for the marathon while 11 people were expected to participate in the handcycle competition, the newspaper reported. In the relay, a total of 550 two-person teams and 434 squads of three to five people signed up. Veteran handcyclist Alicia Dana of Putney, Vermont was first across the finish line and Sergio Reyes, 40, followed as the first marathoner to complete the course. The Palmdale, California resident also won the men’s race in 2019. Annemarie Tuxbury, 28, a native Rhode Islander, won the women’s race.
