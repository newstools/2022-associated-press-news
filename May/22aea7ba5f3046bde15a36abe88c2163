TURIN, Italy (AP) — Tammy Abraham scored twice to help Roma win at Torino 3-0 on Friday and seal a spot in Europe for next season ahead of the Europa Conference League final next week. Both Abraham goals came in the first half of Roma’s final Serie A match. The England international took his tally to 26 goals in all competitions in a fantastic first season at the Italian club.“I would’ve loved to get three to score a hat trick for my team, but the most important thing is we won,” Abraham said. “We wanted to finish the season well. It’s been a long hard season and fair play to all my teammates, we’ve done well. Now we’ve got a final to look forward to and we’re all excited.“Like I’ve always said, I fell in love with this club from the first day. It’s been a good year for me. I’d like to build on this year and hopefully we can finish with a trophy and this would just be the perfect year.”Lorenzo Pellegrini converted a second penalty for Roma 12 minutes from time.ADVERTISEMENTIt was Roma’s first Serie A win in more than a month and ensured José Mourinho’s team finished at least sixth, securing a spot in next year’s Europa League regardless of what the teams below it manage on Saturday.
