An alliance between the Social Democrats, Greens and the Free Democrats — mirroring the one governing at the national level — was also feasible.But Wuest insisted that, as the party with the biggest number of votes, the Christian Democrats were first in line to form a new state government. Alongside the rising cost of living, the war in Ukraine and education, the issue of tackling the causes and effects of climate change in the state — with its long history of heavy industry — was considered an important election issue.North Rhine-Westphalia was among the regions hit by a devastating flash flood last year that fueled calls to end coal mining in the state.
