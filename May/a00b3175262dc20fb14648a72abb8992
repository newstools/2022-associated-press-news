NEW YORK (AP) — A federal appeals court has reversed a ruling that overturned a health care executive’s manslaughter conviction for fatally drugging her 8-year-old autistic son.The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that Manhattan Magistrate Judge Sarah Cave was wrong in 2020 when she ordered a new trial  for Gigi Jordan, who was  convicted in November 2014 of killing her son, Jude Mirra, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2010.Jordan, a wealthy medical entrepreneur, admitted to plunging a lethal dose of medications down her son’s throat with a syringe. She then ingested multiple medications herself and emailed a relative, who alerted authorities.ADVERTISEMENTJordan claimed at her trial  that she had decided to kill herself and Jude because she believed that one of her ex-husbands was planning to have her killed, and that without her the boy would fall under the care of her other ex-husband and would be sexually abused. Both men denied her allegations against them.
