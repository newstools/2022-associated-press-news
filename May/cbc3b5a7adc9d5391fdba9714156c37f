JOHN’S, Antigua (AP) — Batter Keacy Carty has become the first player from St. Maarten to be picked for the West Indies.Carty and fast bowlers Jayden Seales and Shermon Lewis were chosen for their first West Indies one-day international squad on Monday for short tours of the Netherlands and Pakistan.

Holder is being rested to manage his workload, Hetmyer is home for the birth of his first child, and Lewis didn’t meet fitness criteria.The 25-year-old Carty made 57 and 49 against England in March in a test warmup game for the CWI President’s XI.“We were impressed with Carty and the way he goes about his innings,” head selector Desmond Haynes said in a statement. “We saw several glimpses of his ability the way he played against England for the CWI President’s XI. We hope that giving him this opportunity he will recognize the importance of representing West Indies. We think he is a young batsman with great promise, and this is the kind of tour he can show he fits in.”ADVERTISEMENTThe West Indies and the Netherlands meet for their first ODI series in Amstelveen on May 31, June 2 and 4.
