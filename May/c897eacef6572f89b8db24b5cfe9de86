CHICAGO (AP) — New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman is brushing off Houston owner Jim Crane’s recent comments about the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal.Speaking to reporters before New York’s series opener against the White Sox on Thursday night, Cashman called Crane’s remarks “ deflection ” and “trying to equate probably an equivalent of a parking ticket to maybe 162 felonies.”Houston was punished by Major League Baseball after it found the Astros used electronics to steal signs during the Astros’ run to the 2017 World Series title. The process started in 2017, according to baseball’s investigation, and continued through the 2018 season.Houston eliminated New York in the AL championship five years ago, and Cashman described the Astros’ actions as “illegal and horrific” in an interview with The Athletic in March.The Yankees were fined $100,000 by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred for using their dugout phone to relay information about opposing teams’ signs during the 2015 season and part of 2016. That punishment was revealed last month when letter was made public after a federal appeals court ordered it unsealed as part of a dismissed lawsuit by a fan.ADVERTISEMENTIn an interview with USA Today, Crane called Cashman’s March comments “extremely strange.”MLBOverton gets 1st win, Reds beat Pirates 4-0 for 1st shutoutAstros take two from Twins, extend win streak to 10 gamesÁlvarez HRs twice, Astros top Twins 5-0, win 10th straightPhils' Harper small elbow tear; can hit, no throw for month“There’s the letter, and you were doing it, too,” Crane said. “You were there dude. What are you talking about?“If I was one of the teams, and I knew our team was doing it (cheating), I’d keep my mouth shut and just go about our business. But listen, I can only control what’s going on here. I can’t control what the other guys do.”Cashman said he didn’t think anyone would buy what Crane was saying, and pointed out the difference in punishment for Houston and New York.The Astros were fined $5 million and forfeited multiple amateur draft picks as part of the punishment for the scandal. Manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow each lost their jobs.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
