CLEVELAND (AP) — Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson will meet with NFL officials in Texas, a person familiar with the plans told The Associated Press on Monday.Watson, who is facing 22 civil lawsuits from massage therapists accusing him of sexual misconduct, is scheduled to meet with the league representatives this week, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Watson could be disciplined by the league, which is independently investigating whether the 26-year-old violated its personal-conduct policy. Commissioner Roger Goodell said on April 28 that there was no timeframe on any possible ruling on Watson.Reporter Josina Anderson was first to report the league-Watson meeting on Twitter.“We have no update and will decline comment on that tweet,” league spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email to AP. “There’s no timetable as the review is active and ongoing.”ADVERTISEMENTWatson signed a fully guaranteed $230 million contract in March with the Browns, who outbid several teams and have committed to the three-time Pro Bowl QB despite his ongoing legal situation. Two grand juries in Texas declined to indict Watson on criminal charges filed by the women, but the civil cases remain open.NFLFalcons sign LB Nick Kwiatkoski, add WR Geronimo AllisonColumn: Maple Leafs now at 55 years since last championshipRematch: Lightning, Panthers set to meet again in playoffsVikings add analytics expert Demitrius Washington in VP roleWatson has given depositions on several of them, and to this point he has not missed any of Cleveland’s offseason programs.
