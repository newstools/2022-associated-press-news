Barcelona was also without Riqui Puig and Oscar Mingueza because of international duty, and Ferran Torres didn’t make trip because of his vaccination status.ADVERTISEMENTThe Spaniards were also without Martin Braithwaite, who has international duties with Denmark, while Neto and Clement Lenglet were out because of family reasons.Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke made his full-time coaching debut in the match when he led the All-Stars.
