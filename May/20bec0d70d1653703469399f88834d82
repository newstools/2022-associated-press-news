At the other end, Rishabh Pant hit seven fours and a six to score 44 off 30 balls.The duo put on 60 runs off only 25 balls to resurrect Delhi’s hopes. Lucknow appeared to be helping Delhi’s cause with a horrendous fielding display.Marsh was out caught in the eighth over and Lalit Yadav soon followed when he was bowled off Ravi Bishnoi as Delhi stumbled again to 86-4.But the Super Giants’ fielders then dropped three catches and missed two run-out opportunities to allow Delhi to creep closer to Lucknow’s total.Mohsin Khan (4-16) bowled Pant in the 13th over to tip the scales again. Rovman Powell, though, had different ideas as he hit 35 off 21 balls, including three fours and two sixes.Then Patel’s late surge ensured Delhi was in the hunt when the final over began with 21 runs needed.But Stoinis held his nerve allowing Lucknow to register its third consecutive victory.
