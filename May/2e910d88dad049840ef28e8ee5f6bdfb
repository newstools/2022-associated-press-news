MUMBAI, India (AP) — Punjab Kings notched a consolation five-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in their last Indian Premier League game of the season on Sunday.Liam Livingstone smashed an unbeaten 49 off 22 balls and was dropped twice as Punjab raced to 160-5 with almost five overs to spare.Left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar picked up 3-26 in the middle overs that earlier restricted Hyderabad to 157-8 in its 20 overs after it chose to bat first. Opener Abhishek Sharma top-scored for Hyderabad with 43 runs off 32 balls before Livingstone plucked a good catch on the edge of the boundary in Brar’s second over.Abhishek and Rahul Tripathi (20) shared a 47-run second wicket stand before Brar removed both in successive overs. Tripathi was furious with himself after trying to sweep the spinner’s third ball and getting caught at short fine leg. Australian fast bowler Nathan Ellis, playing in only his second game of the season, had Nicholas Pooran (5) caught behind before picking up two more wickets in the penultimate over to finish with 3-40.ADVERTISEMENTSloppy Hyderabad fielding let Punjab cruise to the target in 15.1 overs.
