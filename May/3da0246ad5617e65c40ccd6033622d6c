PHOENIX (AP) — Devin Booker scored 28 points, Deandre Ayton added 20 and the Phoenix Suns beat the Dallas Mavericks 110-80 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in the Western Conference semifinals.The Suns used a huge third quarter to turn a tight game into a comfortable win. Phoenix opened up the second half on an 11-4 run, highlighted by Booker’s two 3-pointers, for a 61-50 lead. Mavs coach Jason Kidd called for a timeout, but it did little to stop the onslaught. The Suns led 82-60 going into the fourth with Booker pouring in 12 points during the third.While the Suns were finally finding some offensive continuity, the Mavs completely lost theirs, scoring just four points in the first six minutes of the third. At times, the Dallas offense regressed to mostly watching Luka Doncic try and work magic, but he couldn’t do it all by himself. The Mavs had 12 turnovers during the third quarter.The top-seeded Suns bounced back after dropping the previous two games and can win the series in Game 6 on Thursday in Dallas.ADVERTISEMENTHEAT 120, 76ERS 85MIAMI (AP) — Jimmy Butler scored 23 points, Max Strus added 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Miami moved one win away from a trip to the Eastern Conference finals by topping Philadelphia.NBABob Lanier, NBA force who left big shoes to fill, dies at 73Booker scores 28, Suns rout Mavericks 110-80 for 3-2 leadFilm about NBA's Antetokounmpo brothers comes to Disney+Heat roll past 76ers 120-85 in Game 5, take 3-2 series leadVictor Oladipo scored 13 for Miami, which got 12 from Bam Adebayo and 10 apiece from Tyler Herro and P.J.
