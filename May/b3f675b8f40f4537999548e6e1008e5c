NEW YORK (AP) — The Yankees lost All-Stars DJ LeMahieu and Giancarlo Stanton to injuries Tuesday night and also placed closer Aroldis Chapman on the injured list.LeMahieu was set to lead off and play third base against the Baltimore Orioles, but New York announced he wouldn’t play about 90 minutes before the first pitch because of left wrist discomfort.Stanton was pulled from the game with right calf tightness. He was replaced by pinch-hitter Estevan Florial in the seventh inning after going 0 for 2 with a strikeout as the designated hitter.LeMahieu, a two-time batting champion, is hitting .250 with three homers and a .704 OPS this season. He’s 5 for 39 (.128) over his past 10 games. Asked about LeMahieu’s struggles earlier Tuesday, manager Aaron Boone said he thought LeMahieu was “close” to ending his slump and did not cite the wrist as an issue.Stanton is batting .285 with 11 homers and a team-leading 35 RBIs.
