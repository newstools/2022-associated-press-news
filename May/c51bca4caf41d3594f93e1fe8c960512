After scoring 40 points to help the Bucks take a 3-2 lead over Boston in the Eastern Conference semifinals on Wednesday night, the two-time MVP asked reporters out of the blue: “If I don’t play after this season, do I still get paid? Do you guys know how it works?”Antetokounmpo, 27, was asked how he would spend his sabbatical. “If I take a year off, what would I do?” he repeated. “I would disappear. I would go to an island in Greece, stay with my family and disappear for a year.”As he walked off, he added: “I’m being serious.” ___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
