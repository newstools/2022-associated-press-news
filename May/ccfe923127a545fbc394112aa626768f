Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has tested positive for COVID-19, his office announced Thursday. The governor took a test after developing a scratchy throat late Wednesday night, officials said in a statement. He plans to isolate for five days and wear a mask for 10 days. Cox said he’s been vaccinated and boosted. “So far, I feel fine,” he said in a statement. The Republican had several public appearances Tuesday and Wednesday, but said few people were close enough to him to potentially be exposed. The “small number” of people who were within 6 feet of him for 15 minutes or more will be notified. No one in his family has tested positive, and since they are vaccinated they don’t need to quarantine but will plan to wear masks for the next 10 days.
