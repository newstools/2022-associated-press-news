NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Nashville Public Library is responding to library scrutiny in Tennessee with a goal to distribute 5,000 “I read banned books” library cards this month.“I want Nashvillians to know: Nashville Public Library will always respect your Freedom to Read — to independently determine what you read, and don’t read, and to exercise your role in determining what your children read,” library Director Kent Oliver said in a news release.The library lists some books that have been banned or challenged for potential banning across the country. The list includes the seven books in the Harry Potter series and “To Kill a Mockingbird.”Book banning put Tennessee in the national spotlight recently after a rural school board in McMinn County voted unanimously to remove “Maus,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust, from the district’s curriculum. Meanwhile, in Williamson County, an affluent region just south of Nashville, school board members agreed to remove “Walk Two Moons” — a book that depicts an American Indian girl’s search for her mother — after parents complained about it.BusinessEurope's farmers stir up biogas to offset Russian energyMajor companies stay mum on thorny abortion issue - for nowRising interest rates in US will hinder foreign economiesAsian stocks follow Wall St lower as rate hike worries growADVERTISEMENTTennessee Gov.
