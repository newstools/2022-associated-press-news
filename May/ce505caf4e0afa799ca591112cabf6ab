ZURICH (AP) — Brazil and Argentina lost their appeals to FIFA on Monday and will have to play the World Cup qualifying game that was abandoned last year in Sao Paulo amid chaos on the field caused by pandemic rule breaches.In one of the most bizarre scenes during the qualifying program for the World Cup, Brazilian health officials came onto the field minutes after kickoff last September to dispute the quarantine status of some Argentina players.Both countries easily qualified for the World Cup as the top two teams in the 10-nation South American group without needing to play the abandoned game. They took part in the draw last month for the final tournament, which is scheduled to be played from Nov. 21-Dec. 18 in Qatar.However, the latest FIFA ruling means Brazil and Argentina seem sure to have to play their essentially meaningless 18th qualifying game, possibly in September.It might be the second time the rivals meet ahead of going to Qatar.ADVERTISEMENTSince the original FIFA disciplinary ruling in February — which imposed fines, player suspensions and an order to replay the qualifier — the soccer federations of Brazil and Argentina agreed to play a friendly game in Australia.That “Superclasico” is scheduled for June 11 in Melbourne.SoccerHaji Wright scores in 6th straight game for AntalyasporTrial of Fox executives in FIFA case delayed to JanuaryAtlanta's Robinson likely to miss World Cup with AchillesAfter great start, Alcaraz heads to Paris among favoritesThe two federations could challenge FIFA again in an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to overturn the replay order.FIFA did cut the amount the two federations were fined.
