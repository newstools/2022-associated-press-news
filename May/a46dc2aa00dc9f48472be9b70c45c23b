ELKHART, Ind. (AP) — A recreational vehicle show will return this year to Elkhart in northern Indiana after a two-year hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Three of the largest RV manufacturers — Thor Industries, Forest River and Winnebago Industries — confirmed they will proceed with the four-day show beginning Sept. 26, the South Bend Tribune reported Wednesday. The massive, dealer-only show, which allows retailers to see the latest offerings from RV manufacturers and suppliers, was cancelled in 2020 and 2021. Most RV manufacturers are reporting a backlog of orders from dealers despite a record 600,240 RVs produced in 2021, the RV Industry Association said. Beyond RV manufacturers, the show is expected to draw at least 130 suppliers who offer original equipment and RV accessories, said Darryl Searer, president of the RV/MH (Manufactured Housing) Hall. “It’s going to be fantastic because everything has been so pent-up the past two years,” Searer said. “The RV provided the answer that allowed people to get out with their families during the pandemic.”
