TOKYO (AP) — Global shares fell on Monday as interest rate hikes and a slowing Chinese economy weighed on investor sentiment. European shares fell in early trading and Asian benchmarks also declined.China reported its exports rose 3.7% over a year earlier in April to $273.6 billion, down sharply from March’s 15.7% growth, as global demand weakened. That added to pressure on the world’s second-largest economy after Shanghai and other industrial cities were shut down to fight virus outbreaks.Imports crept up 0.7% in April to $222.5 billion, in line with the previous month’s sub-1% growth.Companies and investors worry the ruling Communist Party’s “zero-COVID” strategy that temporarily closed most businesses in Shanghai and other industrial centers is disrupting global trade and activity in autos, electronics and other industries.ADVERTISEMENTBut a slowing global economy is also taking a toll.“The blame rests partly with China’s COVID-19 outbreak, which has led to manpower shortages and bottlenecks in the logistics sector. But the extent of these disruptions shouldn’t be overplayed,” Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a commentary. “Instead, the drop in exports seems to mostly reflect softer demand.” Russia-Ukraine warLive updates | Protesters target Russian envoy in  WarsawNo end in sight for Ukraine war as Putin hails Victory DayEXPLAINER: Why Victory Day in Russia is different this yearRussia marks WWII victory overshadowed by UkraineFrance’s CAC 40 slipped 1.4% in early trading to 6,172.41.

ADVERTISEMENTApart from concerns about inflation and coronavirus restrictions, the war in Ukraine is still a major cause for uncertainty. More than 60 people were feared dead after a Russian bomb flattened a school being used as a shelter, Ukrainian officials said. Moscow’s forces pressed their attack on defenders inside Mariupol’s steel plant in an apparent race to capture the city ahead of Russia’s Victory Day holiday Monday.“Russia’s Victory Day today will also bring geopolitical risks back into the limelight as well. President Putin is likely to reiterate his justification for the Ukraine war but markets may be watching for any further efforts to ramp-up military operations to secure the war,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG in Singapore.The Fed is hoping to raise rates and slow the economy enough to snuff out the highest inflation in four decades, but it risks choking off growth if it goes too far or too quickly.
