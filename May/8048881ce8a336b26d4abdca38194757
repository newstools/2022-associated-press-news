MILAN (AP) — AC Milan forward Zlatan Ibrahimović had surgery on his left knee on Wednesday and faces up to eight months on the sidelines — if he decides to continue his playing career.Ibrahimović missed large portions of Milan’s title-winning campaign with injury. The 40-year-old Swede made 23 appearances in Serie A, although most of them were off the bench.Milan said the knee operation, which was performed in France, had been scheduled for a while “to definitively resolve the joint’s instability.”The club added: “The operation was a complete success and the prognosis is estimated between seven and eight months.”Ibrahimović will be 41 by then.After Milan clinched its first Serie A title since 2011 on Sunday, Ibrahimović said he would only continue playing if he felt well and added that it had been a difficult few months for him.His contract ends this year.Ibrahimovic’s return at the start of 2020 signaled a turnaround for Milan that saw the Rossoneri finish second last season and end their 11-year wait for the league title this season.He also helped Milan to the last of its Serie A titles in his first spell at the club.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
