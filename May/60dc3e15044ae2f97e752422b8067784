Shortly afterward, there were “numerous 911 calls for shots fired in the area,” Cmdr. Cristyn Zett told reporters.Zett said the baby boy was pronounced dead at the scene. She said the child’s mother was present but it was not immediately clear who else was there, or whether there was any connection between the shooter and the child.
