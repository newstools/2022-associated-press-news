He picked the tackle.“That will keep the coaches happy,” he said.Captain Nick Malouf said the squad had looked at photos during the week of Australian teams winning past titles and used it as motivation.“We’ve worked so hard for this so I’m glad we’re finally got the reward that I feel like we’ve deserved,” he said. “This is the first Cup final that I’ve or anyone in this group has won. We knew it was possible, so to come out here and do it is incredible.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
