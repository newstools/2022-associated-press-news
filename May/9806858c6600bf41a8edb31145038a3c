Last year it invested a majority stake in Legends, which was formed in 2008 by affiliates of the New York Yankees and the Dallas Cowboys.“Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabéu is hallowed ground in the world of football, and we are honored to be joining this partnership to invest in the innovative, long-term strategic vision that has guided the club’s consistent success over its storied history,” said Alan Waxman, co-founder and CEO of Sixth Street.The Bernabéu is undergoing major renovation, getting a new roof, modern video screens and a retractable field in a project that was expected to cost close to 1 billion euros ($1.05 billion). The goal was to have it completed by the end of the year. Last season, the team played at the small Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium at the club’s training center. The renovation work was expedited as fans were not allowed because of the coronavirus pandemic.Madrid rival Barcelona will also renovate its Camp Nou Stadium. It recently reached a naming rights deal for the venue with streaming company Spotify believed to be worth 400 million euros ($424 million) over 12 seasons.ADVERTISEMENTBarcelona and Madrid did not join in the Spanish league’s deal with private equity firm CVC, which will bring in about 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in investment to Spanish clubs. They say the deal gives too much power to CVC over the clubs’ television rights deals for the next five decades.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni
