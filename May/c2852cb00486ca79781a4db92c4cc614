WNBAWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has determined that WNBA star Brittney Griner is being wrongfully detained in Russia, meaning the United States will more aggressively work to secure her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department said Tuesday.Griner was detained at an airport in February after Russian authorities said a search of her bag revealed vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis. Since then, U.S. officials had stopped short of classifying the Phoenix Mercury player as wrongfully detained and said instead that their focus was on ensuring that she had access in jail to American consular affairs officials.Now, though, U.S. officials have shifted supervision of her case to a State Department section — the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs — that is focused on negotiating for the release of hostages and other Americans classified as being wrongfully detained in other countries. A consular officer did visit in March.SOCCERBOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) — Bournemouth earned promotion back to the Premier League on Tuesday after a two-season absence.Kieffer Moore’s goal in the 83rd minute secured a 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest for Scott Parker’s team and second place in the second-tier Championship with a game to spare.Bournemouth previously spent five seasons in the Premier League before being relegated in 2020.
