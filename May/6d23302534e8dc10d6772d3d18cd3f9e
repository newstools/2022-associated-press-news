BILOXI, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi’s Red Snapper season will open for private recreational anglers and state for-hire vessels at the start of the Memorial Day weekend. The season, beginning at 12:01 a.m. Friday, will be open seven days a week in both state and federal waters, the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources said. As with previous years, a mid-season closure will occur July 4 to allow the department to compile landings information and examine the potential for a season extension.The season will close if the annual catch limit for recreational fishermen is projected to be reached at any point after the season opens. It will also close if the Gulf-wide quota is reached.Anglers fishing for or possessing Red Snapper without a trip authorization number will result in fish confiscation and fines, the department said.
