MADRID (AP) — Atlético Madrid secured a Champions League spot for the 10th straight season after defeating Elche 2-0 in the Spanish league on Wednesday.The victory moved Diego Simeone’s team into third place, one point ahead of Sevilla, which earlier missed its own chance to guarantee a berth in Europe’s top club competition next season after a scoreless home draw against relegation-threatened Mallorca.Matheus Cunha and Rodrigo De Paul scored a goal in each half to leave Atlético six points in front of fifth-place Real Betis with two rounds to go. Betis, which won 3-0 at Valencia on Tuesday, can’t surpass Atlético for the final qualification spot because it loses on the head-to-head tiebreaker.“This team also wants to be playing in the top competitions,” De Paul said. “We had an up-and-down season but to finish like this is important.”The victory left Atlético with a chance to catch Barcelona for second place and a place in the lucrative Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. Barcelona, which defeated Celta Vigo 3-1 at home on Tuesday, is five points in front of Atlético going into the last two games of the season.ADVERTISEMENTReal Madrid clinched its record-extending 35th league title in advance.
