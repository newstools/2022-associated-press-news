ROME (AP) — Goalkeeping blunders continue to make a major impact on the Serie A title race.Following inexcusable errors by Inter Milan’s and Napoli’s goalkeepers in recent matches, AC Milan was the beneficiary of a massive mistake by Fiorentina’s ’keeper in the final 10 minutes of a 1-0 win Sunday that kept the Rossoneri on track for their first Italian league title in more than a decade.Pietro Terracciano’s clearance attempt landed right at the feet of Rafael Leão and the Milan striker quickly strode into Fiorentina’s area and shot past the unfortunate goalkeeper.Terracciano then buried his head in his arms as he sat distraught on the San Siro pitch, while Leão whipped the capacity crowd into a frenzy as he celebrated.With three matches remaining, Milan moved five points ahead of defending champion Inter, which was playing at Udinese later.Milan, which also holds the tiebreaker edge over Inter, controls its own destiny as it attempts to seal its first Serie A title since 2011. Two wins and a draw in Milan’s remaining matches would be enough for the “scudetto” — no matter what Inter does.ADVERTISEMENTInter, meanwhile, is still getting over the mistake that reserve goalkeeper Ionuț Radu made in a 2-1 loss at Bologna midweek.SoccerSon double as Tottenham beats Leicester 3-1 in push for CLAC Milan on track to win Serie A after goalkeeping blunderRicharlison scores, throws flare as Everton beats ChelseaLille crashes to 3-0 defeat to Troyes in French leagueAttempting to clear following a throw in, Radu instead kicked the ball toward his own net and Bologna’s Nicola Sansone had the final touch to make sure it went in for the winner.Last weekend, Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret took too long to clear and when he finally did try to launch the ball away from his goal, Andrea Pinamonti was right on top of him and the ball ricocheted off the Empoli striker and into Meret’s net. That mistake helped Empoli to a 3-2 comeback win and virtually eliminated third-place Napoli from the title race.Milan, which extended its unbeaten streak to 13 matches, plays Hellas Verona, Atalanta and Sassuolo in its last three games of the season.BONUCCI’S BIRTHDAY BRACEDefender Leonardo Bonucci scored twice as Juventus virtually sealed a Champions League spot with a 2-1 win over last-place Venezia.On his 35th birthday, Bonucci first scored with a header following a free kick then found the target following a corner for the winner after Mattia Aramu had equalized for Venezia.Fourth-place Juventus moved 10 points ahead of fifth-place Lazio and within one point of Napoli.Venezia, which fired coach Paolo Zanetti on Wednesday and put youth team coach Andrea Soncin in charge, lost its ninth straight.Venezia remained six points behind 17th-place Cagliari.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports___Andrew Dampf is at https://twitter.com/AndrewDampf
