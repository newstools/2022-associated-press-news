NEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) — Two black bear cubs are settling into their new home at a New Hampshire wildlife rehabilitation facility, after their mother was killed last week by an off-duty police officer.The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said Tuesday the cubs are in good health at the Kilham Bear Center. The agency said wildlife authorities had changed their mind about letting the cubs remain in the wild over “concerns for their safety due to the risk of continued public interaction.”The cubs were orphaned last week when their mother, known as “Bobbi the Bear,” was shot in Newtown, Connecticut. Bobbi was easily identifiable by her ear tags and was popular among local residents, who posted sightings of her on Facebook.Annie Hornish, Connecticut’s director of the Humane Society of the United States, said in a statement that the two orphaned cubs were too young to survive in the wild on their own.ADVERTISEMENTThe cubs could be seen climbing on a structure made of logs at the rehabilitation facility in a photo posted on the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s Facebook page. The agency said the bears had been found in a tree and were captured using a tranquillizer.OdditiesFinland brewery launches NATO beer with 'taste of security'Man in Japan gambles COVID town funds mistakenly sent to himBad Kitty: German town grounds cats to save rare birdsJudge: Regulators wrong to ban beer label that had naked manEnvironmental conservation police are investigating the mother bear’s killing Thursday in Newtown, but haven’t released details.
