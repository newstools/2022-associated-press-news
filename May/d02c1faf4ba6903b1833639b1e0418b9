MOTT, N.D. (AP) — After more than 50 years of providing care to the elderly and others, operators of a nursing home in southwestern North Dakota will soon close their doors for good. The Good Samaritan Society home in Mott plans to close in July, leaving families of its residents searching for new senior living options. Darwyn Mayer is among those looking for other arrangements for his parents, who are among the residents who will be displaced. “They won’t feel a part of this community anymore, which I think is the sad part,” Mayer tells KFYR-TV. Mayer says Good Samaritan Society-Mott met with families about the closure and provided a list of the closest nursing homes. Its executive director, Phil Samuelson, said that the pandemic has put stress on the senior care industry.Samuelson said in a statement that staffing challenges, a decline in residents and increased operating costs also contributed to the decision to close the facility, which joined Sanford Health in 2019.ADVERTISEMENT“It’s a blow, we got to figure out what our next step is because we can’t afford to lose any more people or businesses in our community,” said Mott Mayor Troy Mosbrucker.The mayor said city leaders were hoping another owner would step in and keep the facility operating as a nursing home. But, Mosbrucker said they were informed in a meeting with Samuelson that the building sale will include a clause stating the home can’t be used for healthcare.“This is not how I expect them to treat a small community,” said Mosbrucker.
