NEW YORK (AP) — Best Buy Co. posted first-quarter results that showed shoppers pulled back on spending, while higher costs ate into profits.The nation’s largest consumer electronics chain also on Tuesday cut its annual outlook, citing a deteriorating economic environment.Best Buy was among a handful of big winners in the pandemic, as shoppers flocked to its store and website to buy equipment like laptops to create home offices to help them with remote work or cater to the needs of their children for virtual learning. But like many retailers, Best Buy is struggling with rising costs for everything from labor to shipping as supply chain backups hit companies worldwide. The electronics chain also had to navigate global chip shortages. Another round of COVID-19 lockdowns in China is only worsening the problem. And soaring fuel costs are hurting the bottom line. Meanwhile, consumers’ demand for electronics is cooling as they go back to the office and resume more normal lives. Inflation is also making shoppers scrutinize their purchases. ADVERTISEMENTBest Buy CEO Corie Barry said in a statement that the company had expected this year’s results to be weaker than last year as it lapped stimulus payments and other government support and planned for higher costs in its supply chain. But she noted that macro economic conditions worsened since it provided its financial outlook in early March, which resulted in its sales being slightly lower than its expectations. Those trends have continued into the second quarter and, as a result, it revised its sales and profitability expectations for the year.BusinessEXPLAINER: What's the 4-nation Quad, where did it come from?At Davos, climate debate over role of oil in 'going green'Biden: Leaders navigating 'dark hour' after Ukraine invasionSocial media hammered by mounting questions over advertisingNeil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, said given the multitude of challenges, Best Buy fared reasonably well. It noted that while Best Buy has suffered from out-of-stocks because of supply issues, it still has better availability than others, because of its size and its strong relationship with vendors. That has helped it retain customers and spending, he noted.Still, Saunders said he is worried about the consumer psyche. “Electronics are highly discretionary, big-ticket items,” he said. ”This puts them directly in the firing line of households looking to trim expenditure.” He also noted that the general demand for electronics is also taking a hit from society returning to normality. “People are home less, many have returned to the office and classroom, and leisure activities such as attending sports events and movies has risen,” he added.
