ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A black bear wandered into Albany, climbed a tree several blocks from the state Capitol and rested on branches about 30 feet (nine meters) up Tuesday before workers tranquilized the animal and caught it in a net.The bear plunged into the net in the early afternoon after a state wildlife crew used a fire department ladder truck to get in close to immobilize the animal. The bear had climbed a towering pine tree on the edge of Washington Park in a residential neighborhood about a half mile from the Capitol.The sprawling park is in the center of Albany, hemmed in by busy streets and surrounded by commercial strips and city neighborhoods of brownstones or single-family homes.Albany police tweeted out several pictures of the bear in the tree, including one in which the animal looked like it was taking a nap.Police said the bear would be medically evaluated before being released into a forested area of the Catskills, south of the city.Police closed off the street for a few hours as a state Department of Environmental Conservation crew worked to get the bear safely out of the tree.
