A look at what’s happening around the majors on Saturday:___A LUCKY NON-BREAKThe Twins avoided a daunting injury when it was determined star shortstop Carlos Correa’s right middle finger is not broken as was initially feared after he was hit by a pitch Thursday.“Thank you Lord,” Correa tweeted.Correa will be evaluated day to day, and he won’t have to go on the injured list.For now, top prospect Royce Lewis will replace Correa. Lewis was recalled from Triple-A St. Paul to make his major league debut at home against Oakland, filling the roster spot of infielder Luis Arraez, who was put on the COVID-19 list.After a slow start at the plate in his first season with Minnesota, Correa was hitting .412 (14 for 34) with eight RBIs in his last eight games for the AL Central leaders. Correa signed a three-year, $105.3 million contract with the Twins that comes with an opt-out clause after this season and next. He has provided instant leadership and a steady presence at shortstop where he won the 2021 AL Gold Glove Award.ADVERTISEMENTTO THE SHOWERSA day after six games were rained out, the weather could still cause scheduling problems in some places this weekend.MLBBrewers beat Braves 6-3; Acuña homers in return for AtlantaMLB umpire apologizes after ejecting D-backs star BumgarnerMets-Phillies postponed by rain; doubleheader in AugustRangers-Yankees series opener postponed; doubleheader SundayThe Royals-Orioles in Baltimore and Rangers-Yankees in New York were called off and set to be made up Sunday as part of doubleheaders.
