CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Guardians traded infielder Yu Chang to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday for cash.Chang had been designated for assignment last week.Once a promising prospect for Cleveland, the 26-year-old Chang played in just four games for the Guardians this season and struck out seven times in 10 at-bats. He also missed time after being placed on the COVID-19 list.Chang batted .228 with nine homers and 39 RBIs in 89 games for Cleveland in 2021. His strong finish — seven homers and 25 RBIs — in the final three months put him in position to win a utility job this season.However, Owen Miller’s strong spring training pushed Chang aside and now he’ll get a fresh start with the Pirates.Chang batted .208 with 10 homers and 46 RBIs in 131 games over four seasons with Cleveland.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
