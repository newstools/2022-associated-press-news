The transportation, trade and utilities sector had about 1,400 more jobs than the prior year, and there were about 500 more jobs in oil and gas. But job numbers in most sectors lag levels reported in April 2019, the department said. The education and health sector had 100 more jobs last month than in April 2019.

She said high oil prices could encourage more employment in the oil and gas sector but said it’s unclear if the sector will reach its past highs. She noted that job gains in that sector have so far been slow.BusinessWall Street nears bear market at the end of a bruising weekA bear market is hitting Wall Street.
