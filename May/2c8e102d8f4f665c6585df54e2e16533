CHICAGO (AP) — A young girl died Wednesday morning after Chicago firefighters responding to a fire at an apartment building on the city’s South Side found her in a bedroom, a fire official said.Firefighters who responded to calls about a heavy fire and someone possibly trapped in an apartment found the girl under debris in the second-floor unit of the apartment building in Chicago’s Roseland neighborhood, said Larry Langford, a spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department.He said firefighters tried to resuscitate the child, who was 2 or 3 years old, but she was pronounced dead at a hospital.“When firefighters got to the scene, they knew the chances of survival were slim because fire was blowing out the windows,” Langford told the Chicago Sun-Times.He said the apartment was full of a lot of furniture and other objects that made searching it difficult.Two adults escaped from the burning apartment, and someone may have jumped to safety from a window before the fire was extinguished before it spread into adjacent units.Langford said investigators are looking into what caused the fire at the apartment, which had no working smoke detectors.
