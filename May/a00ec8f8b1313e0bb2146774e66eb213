OKLAHOMA (AP) — An Oklahoma judge should expunge a portion of a state grand jury report that is sharply critical of Gov. Kevin Stitt, according to a motion filed by Stitt.The portion of the May 13 report calling Stitt’s meetings with his appointees to the state Pardon and Parole Board before they took office “grossly improper” is not allowed under a state law that limits grand juries to issuing only indictments, according to the motion filed Wednesday.The report said Stitt and the appointees discussed upcoming votes and dismissal of the agency’s director, violating the spirit of Oklahoma’s Open Meetings Act.The motion called Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, who requested the grand jury, “overzealous.” Prater, who is not seeking reelection, said in a statement Thursday that the grand jury’s report was based on its investigation of the parole board.“The Grand Jurors delivered their report to the Presiding Judge,” Prater wrote. “The Judge reviewed the report and found it to be proper to be filed.”ADVERTISEMENTThe law cited by Stitt’s motion says a grand jury may report “the condition and operation” of public offices but not allege “willful misconduct or malfeasance” of a public officer.Stitt also seeks a copy of grand jury transcripts.
