This was the first time the NFL put the combine up for bidding, with Dallas and Los Angeles also seeking to host.“Indy’s vision brings together its long legacy of successfully hosting the combine and executing the evaluation process, with an exciting focus on innovating and further growing the event from a fan and media perspective,” said Peter O’Reilly, NFL executive vice president of club business and league events.“Indy is a city built to host major sporting events, and I’m proud the combine will continue to stay in our city,” Colts owner Jim Irsay said.ADVERTISEMENTStudies showed that the 2022 combine generated an estimated $9.6 million in economic impact for the city.Irsay and his family plan a new legacy program focused on mental health and designed to benefit Indianapolis residents as well.NFLRavens acquire Fuller in another attempt to help secondaryMan who killed Husker football player grandad dies in prison4 HBCU medical schools join NFL diversity initiativeSeahawks OTAs have different feel with no Wilson, WagnerIn 2023, the combine will take place Feb. 28–March 6, and in 2024 the dates are Feb. 27-March 4.While the combine is a growing event, the Pro Bowl could be on its last legs. Many owners believe the game is not up to NFL standards and has been devolving over the past few years. While it has not become a touch football exercise, the Pro Bowl has little intensity, and players regularly drop out of participating.Commissioner Roger Goodell frequently has acknowledged that while it’s important to honor the players who have earned Pro Bowl recognition, there are questions about the quality of the game. So the league will have further discussions with the players and their union, as well as with NFL partners, on the future of the all-star contest played the weekend before the Super Bowl.The league also announced four new international home marketing areas, with the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams adding New Zealand and the Philadelphia Eagles granted Australia, New Zealand and Ghana, making them the first NFL franchise to enter a market in Africa. The Eagles and Rams can activate in their newly awarded markets on June 1.The expanded program, launched in January, now includes 19 teams granted access to 30 international areas across 10 countries. Each team has access to international territories for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization as the NFL seeks to become more global.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
