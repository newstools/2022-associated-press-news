LOS ANGELES (AP) — Phillies slugger Bryce Harper has a small tear in his right elbow and won’t throw for four weeks, but the reigning NL MVP will stay in the lineup as Philadelphia’s designated hitter.Harper will receive a platelet-rich plasma injection Sunday and won’t play that day, manager Joe Girardi said before Thursday night’s game at Dodger Stadium.Harper was hitting .269 with six home runs, 19 RBIs and an .847 OPS going into the series opener against Los Angeles. He won his second NL MVP award last season.The 29-year-old star has spent most of his time at DH this year because of his elbow trouble. Of his 31 games, he’s played in his usual right field spot just eight times.The small tear in Harper’s ulnar collateral ligament was revealed during a visit with Dr. Neal ElAttrache in Los Angeles earlier in the day.“What we saw today confirmed probably a new small tear,” Girardi said. “Harp will be no throwing for four weeks. He’ll have a PRP injection on Sunday and we’ll go from there.”ADVERTISEMENTGirardi said Harper might also not play Tuesday night at home against San Diego.“He’ll stay in our lineup Wednesday, Thursday and Friday,” Girardi said.Harper was listed as the DH on Thursday and took batting practice before the game.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
