EUNICE, La. (AP) — A hospital in Louisiana’s largest system is giving Louisiana State University at Eunice $698,000 to expand allied health programs. Ochsner Lafayette General says it wants to boost the nursing and surgical technology programs at the college, news agencies report. Officials say both programs will be able to add students to courses that start in August. The nursing program will be able to add 30 and the surgical technology program will add 24. “This is just another great example of what happens when local workforce leaders invest in our universities to help grow the area’s economy,” LSU Eunice Chancellor Nancee Sorenson said. “We look forward to our partnership providing south Louisiana with qualified graduates to serve as invaluable front-line healthcare workers.”The hospital has partnered with LSU Eunice since 2016. Officials said the hospital donated classroom and clinical laboratory space in Lafayette to the school in 2016 and provided more space in 2017 for the college’s surgical technology program.ADVERTISEMENTNearly 100 nursing students have graduated from courses taught at the hospital campus. “Ochsner Lafayette General is committed to investing in the communities we serve,” OLG CEO Patrick Gandy said. “That means we’re investing not only in our facilities and quality of life initiatives that make Acadiana so great, but also our current and future employees.”
