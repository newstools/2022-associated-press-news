He is scheduled to go to Italy and the United Kingdom after Thailand.Japanese economic investments have been key to Thailand’s industrialization over the past six decades, especially in the automotive industry, which now seeks to expand in the electric vehicles sector.Also likely to be on their agenda is the violent conflict in Thailand’s neighbor, Myanmar, which some experts characterize as a civil war. Several governments have imposed sanctions against Myanmar’s military for the takeover last year, and other Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia and Singapore have condemned its abuses.ADVERTISEMENTThailand and Japan share a softer approach and have been less critical of the ruling military. Thailand has significant economic interests in Myanmar and has its own past history of army rule. Japan has historically had friendly ties with the military governments that have ruled Myanmar most of the past six decades.Russia-Ukraine warPelosi, in surprise Kyiv trip, vows unbending US support Live updates l Commander glad for steel mill evacuationsLook for the orange vest: Ukrainians in Romania help othersGermany: Quitting Russian oil by late summer is 'realistic'Japanese officials have said Kishida would also discuss a possible Reciprocal Access Agreement with Thailand, aimed at deepening their defense cooperation.
