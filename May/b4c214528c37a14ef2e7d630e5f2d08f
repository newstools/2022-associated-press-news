ZURICH (AP) — FIFA fined Senegal’s soccer federation 175,000 Swiss francs ($180,000) on Monday for fan disorder at a World Cup playoff game, including shining laser pointers at Egypt star Mohamed Salah in the penalty shootout.Salah’s face was a blur of vivid green light  when he prepared to take his penalty, which he blasted over the bar. Senegal went on to win the shootout in Dakar in March with Salah’s Liverpool teammate Sadio Mané scoring the decisive spot kick.FIFA said its disciplinary committee also looked into a pitch invasion by Senegal fans, an offensive banner and the national federation’s “failure to ensure that law and order are maintained in the stadium.”Senegal was also ordered to play a future competitive game in an empty stadium.The FIFA disciplinary panel also judged dozens of similar cases  from World Cup qualifying games played since January and handed out several other fines and stadium closures.ADVERTISEMENTSoccerAP SportlightVillarreal’s European hopes hanging on win over Liverpool  Freiburg vetoes joint merchandise with Leipzig at cup finalCzech Republic coach Šilhavý gets contract extension Nigeria was punished with a 150,000 Swiss francs ($154,000) fine and one-game stadium closure.
