MUNICH (AP) — Danish teenager Holger Rune won the BMW Open final on Sunday to claim his first ATP Tour title after Botic van de Zandschulp was forced to retire.The eighth-seeded van de Zandschulp led 4-3 in the opening set — with Rune serving at 40-15 — when he withdrew due to chest pains.“This was probably the worst way to win a final,” said Rune, who celebrated his 19th birthday on Friday. “I was obviously expecting a very tough match and he came out very strong. I just wish him all the best, a speedy recovery, and we all just hope to see him back on the court very soon.”Rune, who stunned top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round, did not drop a set at the clay-court tournament. He also ousted Jiri Lehecka, Emil Ruusuvuori and Oscar Otte on his way to his first final.The 26-year-old van de Zandschulp was also playing his first final after seeing off Miomir Kecmanovic, Casper Ruud, Egor Gerasimov and Brandon Nakashima.ADVERTISEMENTThe 70th-ranked Rune became the third youngest champion in Munich after Guillermo Perez-Roldan won at age 17 in 1987 and successfully defended his title a year later. Rune is the fifth first-time winner on the ATP Tour this year.TennisRune wins BMW Open after van de Zandschulp retires After great start, Nadal returns from injury at Madrid OpenHalep beats No 2 Badosa to return to Madrid Open last 16 Danish teen Rune to play Van de Zandschulp in BMW Open final“I’m super happy, of course,” Rune said. “As I said, not the way I want it to end, but if I look through the week, what a week! ...
