SUTTON COLDFIELD, England (AP) — Thorbjorn Olesen finished eagle-birdie to shoot 3-under 69 and take a three-stroke lead into the final round of the British Masters as he bids for a first win in four years amid a career rebuild.The Danish golfer broke a four-way tie for the lead on Saturday after almost holing his approach from 242 yards on the par-5 17th hole. He tapped in from two feet for a second eagle of the day and holed a birdie putt from 23 feet at the last.Olesen was 11 under overall, with third-round leader Hurly Long (73) and Marcus Armitage (70) the nearest challengers on 8 under.“I know how hard it is to win out here — it never comes easy,” Olesen said.“My attitude today was really good. If I can keep staying aggressive and not worrying too much, that’s very important.”American Chase Hanna was part of a five-man group a further shot behind after shooting 66, the lowest round of the day at the Belfry.ADVERTISEMENTOlesen’s last win was at the Italian Open in June 2018.
