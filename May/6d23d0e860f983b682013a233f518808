DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Resolute batting at the top of the order helped put Sri Lanka in a comfortable position on the rain-interrupted third day of the second cricket test against Bangladesh on Wednesday.Sri Lanka reached 282-5, lowering the first innings deficit to 83 before the bad light brought a premature end to the day.Bangladesh was bowled out for 365 with Mushfiqur Rahim unbeaten on 175 and Liton Das scoring 141.Showers, however, washed out the post-lunch session.Angelo Mathews, who scored 199 in the first test, was batting on 58 with Dinesh Chandimal on 10.“The target is to take a lead first and then make it bigger,” Sri Lanka coach Navid Nawaz said. “We’ve got two experienced batters in the wicket at this moment and hopefully they will be successful to execute the plan. I think still it is possible to win the game from this situation.”Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne hit 80 from 155 balls with nine fours.
