RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein left a Raleigh hospital on Wednesday after being treated earlier this week for what he called a “minor stroke.” Stein’s office confirmed his release the day after the two-term Democrat announced he was hospitalized. He said doctors removed a small blood clot and that he had no lingering effects.Stein, 55, wrote previously that he had stroke-like symptoms Monday night after he and his wife walked the family dog. Stein tweeted Wednesday about him and his wife celebrating their anniversary by lunching at a favorite restaurant. A former state senator from Wake County, Stein has been considered a potential 2024 gubernatorial candidate. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is barred by term limits from running again.
