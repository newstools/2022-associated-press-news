SUTTON COLDFIELD, England (AP) — Thorbjorn Olesen shot a 6-under 66 to share the lead after the opening round of the British Masters on Thursday in his bid to end a four-year title drought and get his career back on track after a damaging court case.Olesen’s last win was at the Italian Open in June 2018. He was suspended by the European tour the following year after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman and being intoxicated on a flight following a World Golf Championships event in Tennessee.Olesen was acquitted by a court in December after saying he had no memory of his behavior because he had been drinking alcohol and taking sleeping tablets. The Danish player said the case had a “devastating impact” on his career, having plunged down the ranking from his position at No. 62 at the time of the incidents.Now ranked No. 376, Olesen hasn’t finished higher than a tie for 12th in any of his seven events on the European tour this year but made a strong start in this week’s tournament at The Belfry — a course in central England that has hosted the Ryder Cup.ADVERTISEMENTOlesen birdied three of his first six holes and three of his last six holes in a bogey-free round after going out among the morning starters.

But I feel I am on the right track now and starting to get a team back together that is helping me again -- I think that is very important.”Olesen and Fox were a stroke clear of three players — Hurly Long, Ashun Wu and Richie Ramsay.There was a four-way tie for sixth place at 4 under, two shots off the lead, featuring Rasmus Hojgaard, Justin Walters, Edoardo Molinari and Brandon Stone.___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
