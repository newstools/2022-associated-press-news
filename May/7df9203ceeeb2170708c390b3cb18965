After Colorado rallied within 8-7 in the top of the fourth, he answered in the bottom half with his first homer of the season, a three-run drive.Robles, who was hit by a pitch in the sixth and popped out in the eighth, raised his average from .228 to .248 after beginning the season 0 for 18.“I believe in myself and in the work I’ve put in,” Robles said through an interpreter. “I know the results will be there eventually and I’ve just got to keep grinding.”The 25-year-old outfielder was Washington’s top prospect from 2017-19. He played in 155 games for the 2019 World Series champions, hitting .255 with 17 homers, 65 RBIs and 28 stolen bases. Last season, however, Robles hit .203 in 107 games and spent the final month of the season with Triple-A Rochester.ADVERTISEMENT“I truly believe in him and so does this organization,” manager Dave Martinez said. “He’s got unbelievable skills and we just got to try and get it out of him and we’re gonna stick with him. As I’ve said before, there’s gonna be days where I’ll give him a little breather but we want him to be our everyday centerfielder.”MLBFarmer's power, Aristides' arm send Reds past Giants 3-2Semien ends HR drought with slam, Rangers rout A's 11-4Ramírez, Bieber help Guardians beat Tigers 8-1Alcantara smothers Braves with 14 whiffs in Marlins' 4-1 winC.J.
