He said his son found a shotgun hidden in the home and threatened to kill his father, the woman and himself if police were called.Larson and the woman had met a week earlier on a dating app, investigators said.He had been released from prison just two weeks before the standoff, Clinton County Sheriff Larry Fish said.Court documents show Larson has been charged with kidnapping, domestic assault, armed criminal action and unlawful possession of a gun.
