PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The New York Mets released second baseman Robinson Canó prior to Sunday’s doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies.The move comes a week after the slumping Cano was designated for assignment despite nearly $45 million remaining on his contract.The Mets announced the news in their pregame notes and after manager Buck Showalter met with reporters prior to Sunday’s games.The 39-year-old Canó sat out last season while serving his second suspension for performance-enhancing drugs. He batted .195 (8 for 41) with one home run, three RBIs and a paltry .501 OPS in 43 plate appearances for the NL East-leading Mets.Canó has a .302 career batting average with 335 home runs, 1,305 RBIs and an .842 OPS in 17 seasons. He has 2,632 hits, including 571 doubles. Canó is owed $44,703,297 by the Mets from the remainder of the $240 million, 10-year contract he signed with Seattle. He has lost $35,741,935 because of the two drug suspensions.ADVERTISEMENTNow that he has been released by the Mets, a team could sign him for a prorated share of the $700,000 minimum this season and also pay the $710,000 minimum in 2023.MLBPlate umpire Ron Kulpa hit in mask by foul ball, leaves gameMets release second baseman Robinson CanóRed Sox scratch Wacha, put him on IL; Houck starts insteadAP SportlightIn a deal that also netted closer Edwin Díaz, the Mets shipped five players to Seattle in December 2018 — including prized outfield prospect Jarred Kelenic, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2018 amateur draft.
