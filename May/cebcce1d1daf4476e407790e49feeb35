BERLIN (AP) — Saša Kalajdžić earned relegation-threatened Stuttgart a 2-2 draw at league champion Bayern Munich on Sunday to ensure three teams will be fighting for survival in the Bundesliga’s final round.Kalajdžić’s 52nd-minute equalizer was enough to move Stuttgart three points behind Hertha Berlin — which has an inferior goal difference — and three points ahead of Arminia Bielefeld, which still has a mathematical chance of overtaking Stuttgart next weekend to take the relegation playoff place.Stuttgart’s draw ensured Augsburg could no longer be relegated, with a relieved Augsburg team barely performing later in a 4-0 loss at Leipzig. Two goals from Christopher Nkunku helped to lift Leipzig back into a Champions League qualification place ahead of the final round next weekend.Stuttgart has a home game against Cologne in the final round, when Hertha faces Borussia Dortmund away and Bielefeld hosts Leipzig.ADVERTISEMENTStuttgart wasted several good chances to score in Munich, where Bayern was under pressure to put on a good performance after a lackluster 3-1 defeat to Mainz last weekend after winning the league the week before. Bayern’s players were also facing criticism for taking a short break in Ibiza after the loss in Mainz.SoccerStuttgart draws in Munich to extend fight for survivalGuardiola gets spiky over City title rivalry with LiverpoolMATCHDAY: Roma and Fiorentina meet in hunt for European spotSterling puts City 3 points clear of Liverpool in title bidStuttgart got off to a fine start through Tiago Tomás eighth-minute goal, when he fired Omar Marmoush’s cross in under the crossbar.Thomas Müller struck the crossbar and Leon Goretzka also went close for Bayern in response, before Marmoush missed another great chance in a one-on-one with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer in the 23rd.Müller drew a good save from Florian Müller in the 28th before Serge Gnabry forced Bayern’s equalizer in the 35th.
