BALTIMORE (AP) — Minnesota Twins infielder Miguel Sanó will undergo surgery to repair a meniscus tear in his left knee and there’s no timeframe for his return, manager Rocco Baldelli said Tuesday.Sanó was placed on the 10-day injured list Monday. He sustained the injury on April 26 while celebrating Minnesota’s 5-4 victory over the Tigers, a game decided on the final play.Sanó returned to play Saturday but left early because of knee pain.“He did try to play through it but he did something during the course of that game, and we had to take him out,” Baldelli said.Sanó was not in the clubhouse Tuesday afternoon before the Twins faced the Orioles. Baldelli said the procedure will take place later this week.“He was definitely in favor of getting this done, and I think our medical staff agrees with him,” Badelli said.It’s uncertain how long Sanó will be sidelined.ADVERTISEMENT“I don’t have a timeline,” Baldelli said. It’s been a difficult season for the 28-year-old Sanó, who’s batting .093 (5 for 54) with one home run. Making matters worse was that he’s going to miss time after sustaining an injury during a postgame celebration.MLBCarrasco navigates 8 innings, Mets sweep twinbill vs BravesDerek King remains in running for Blackhawks coaching jobNationals reinstate Dee Strange-Gordon from IL, option FoxFrom stadium to sea, LA Dodgers unveil All-Star Game plans“There’s no way to talk about (the injury) without mentioning that,” Baldelli said. “Frankly, dwelling on that doesn’t accomplish much. The guy just wants to get (the surgery) done as quickly as possible so he can get back on the field.”Sano broke into the majors with the Twins in 2015 and he spent his entire career with the club. He hit 34 homers in 2019 and 30 last season.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
