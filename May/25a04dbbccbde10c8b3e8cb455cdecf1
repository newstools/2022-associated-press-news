MADRID (AP) — After keeping a promise that it wouldn’t give Real Madrid an honor guard before the game, Atlético Madrid went on to beat the newly crowned Spanish league champion 1-0 Sunday and moved closer to securing a Champions League spot.Atlético clinched the victory in the last city derby of the season with a 40th-minute penalty kick converted by Yannick Carrasco. The win gave fourth-place Atlético a six-point advantage over fifth-place Real Betis, the first team outside the Champions League spots with three rounds to go. Betis lost 2-1 at home to second-place Barcelona on Saturday. Sevilla stayed one point in front of Atlético after salvaging a stoppage-time 1-1 draw at Villarreal earlier Sunday.Madrid clinched its record-extending 35th league title last weekend with a 4-0 home win against Espanyol.Madrid’s fans wanted Atlético to keep a tradition whereby players line up to applaud their opponents as they enter the field before kickoff. But Atlético said ahead of the match that it was not going to do this to avoid upsetting its fans at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium.ADVERTISEMENTMadrid was coming off its epic victory over Manchester City to advance to the Champions League final.SoccerNo honor guard for Real Madrid as Atlético beats championPSG held to 2-2 draw; Marseille restores 3-point lead in 2ndGuardiola gets spiky with Liverpool over City title rivalryBirthday boy Tonali scores 2 as Milan beats Verona to go topCoach Carlo Ancelotti rested some of his regular starters, including goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, midfielder Luka Modric, forward Vinícius Júnior and striker Karim Benzema.
