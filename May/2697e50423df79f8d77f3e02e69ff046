HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) — Numerous tenants who faced eviction after the end of New York’s eviction moratorium in January had their overdue rent paid by an anonymous person who donated $60,000 to a public housing complex in Hudson.The donation was made through a Black-led housing justice group called the Hudson-Catskill Housing Coalition for tenants at the Hudson Housing Authority, The Times Union reported Wednesday.Nick Zachos, the authority’s temporary executive director, said 50 lease-holders would benefit from the donation. It was to cover rent amounts that range from a few hundred to a thousand dollars.ADVERTISEMENTZachos said the coalition requested all of the outstanding rent be paid off instead of holding a selection process.Coalition Senior Policy Advisor Quintin Cross said he would not reveal the name of the donor.“If folks are evicted from (HHA), we know they’re homeless after that — they have no place else to go,” Cross said.
