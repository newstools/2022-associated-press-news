LONDON (AP) — As you were in the pursuit of Champions League qualification. At the other end of the Premier League, though, the relegation scrap just got even tighter.Arsenal remained in fourth place after Gabriel’s header secured a 2-1 win at West Ham to stay two points ahead of Tottenham after its north London rival beat Leicester 3-1 on Sunday through Son Heung-min’s double.Chelsea looks well placed to qualify for the Champions League despite now being only three points ahead of Arsenal with four games remaining after losing 1-0 at Everton. It’s a result — secured by Richarlison — that gives Everton renewed hope of avoiding relegation after a 68-year stay in the top division.Everton moved two points from safety with five matches to go and a game in hand over both Leeds and Burnley, which are just above the drop zone.FLARE THROWNRicharlison’s four goals in his last five league matches is as many as he scored in his first 21 games of the season. ADVERTISEMENTThe latest came 59 seconds into the second half at Goodison Park. Richarlison and Demarai Gray pressured Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta into losing possession and the Brazilian benefited by sweeping a shot past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.

The South Korea forward was denied a shot at a hat trick after being substituted by manager Antonio ConteADVERTISEMENT“We are talking about a great player, fantastic player,” Conte said. “But it’s important at the end of the season to celebrate a big achievement with the team. Otherwise it remains only a personal success to score these types of goals.”Kelechi Iheanacho scored a stoppage-time consolation for Leicester, which is 11th in the standings and focused on its Europa Conference League semifinal against Roma on Thursday after drawing 1-1 in the first leg.DEFENDERS’ HEADERSLike Leicester, seventh-place West Ham’s focus is on Europe and its second-leg game in the Europa League semifinals against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday.Arsenal still found it hard going before Bukayo Saka’s corner was headed in by Rob Holding in the 38th minute for his first-ever Premier League goal since making his debut in 2016.The lead lasted seven minutes as Jarrod Bowen leveled from close range before the break. But Arsenal went in front again nine minutes into the second half when Gabriel Martinelli crossed to an unmarked Gabriel for a diving header that beat former Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski at the far post.After three straight losses, Arsenal has now won three in a row.“It’s nice and close and we’ll have to keep going for the rest of the season,” Holding said. “Your heart rate will be going high at times, but if we can keep controlling what we do and picking up points that’s all we can worry about.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
