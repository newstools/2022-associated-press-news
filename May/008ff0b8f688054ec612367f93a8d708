DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Mushfiqur Rahim’s unbeaten 175 helped Bangladesh move into a strong position in the second cricket test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday despite a fightback led by visiting captain Dimuth Karunaratne late on Day 2.Mushfiqur and Liton Das (141) scored all but 49 of Bangladesh’s runs in its total of 365, combining for a record sixth-wicket partnership of 272 runs after the hosts had been reeling at 24-5 at one point.Bangladesh, which had six batters dismissed for ducks, was all out soon after lunch and only took two wickets in nearly two sessions as Sri Lanka fought back to trail by 222 runs at stumps.Karunaratne was not out on 70, having shared a 95-run stand with Oshada Fernando (57) for the opening wicket as a disciplined Bangladesh attack struggled to get any assistance from the pitch.Fernando reviewed successfully to overturn an lbw appeal when on 4 in the first over of the innings, while Karunaratne could have gone for 37 had skipper Mominul Haque not dropped him at short square-leg.ADVERTISEMENTPacer Ebadot Hossain (1-31) broke through with the wicket of Fernando, who edged a length delivery to slip soon after reaching his fifth half-century.Just before stumps, left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan (1-19) gave Bangladesh another breakthrough, trapping Kusal Mendis lbw for 11.
