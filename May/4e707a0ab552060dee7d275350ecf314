Other organizers attending include those working to unionize Starbucks, outdoors retailer REI and the animation studio Titmouse.Just 10.3% of workers belong to unions, down from 20.1% in 1983, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.But union organizing has gained momentum as younger workers have sought to unionize at tech companies such as Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The White House meeting will include discussions about how to inspire workers to choose to join unions.Harris chairs an administration task force on worker organizing. Walsh, a former Boston mayor and union official, is the vice chair.
