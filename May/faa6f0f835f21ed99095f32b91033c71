Fulton County prosecutors asked that he remain jailed, telling the judge some state witnesses have been threatened.A bond hearing for Young Thug, whose given name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, was postponed until next month, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Prosecutors say his attorney, Brian Steel, should be disqualified as Williams’ lawyer because he represents others charged in the same case.Both rappers were charged in a sweeping indictment along with 26 others for violating Georgia’s anti-racketeering law as members of a street gang that prosecutors say committed violent crimes over roughly a decade and and promoted its activities in songs and on social media.ADVERTISEMENTThe indictment includes a list of 181 acts that prosecutors say were committed starting in 2013 as part of the alleged racketeering conspiracy to further the gang’s interests.EntertainmentBurn-proof edition of 'The Handmaid's Tale' up for auctionBruce Springsteen and E Street Band to tour in US, EuropeLéa Seydoux, once again, rules the Cannes Film Festival'Top Gun' and Tom Cruise return to the danger zoneAttorneys for both Williams and Kitchens have denied the allegations.Young Thug co-wrote the hit “This is America” with Childish Gambino, making history when it became the first hip-hop track to win the song of the year Grammy in 2019.Gunna, who is signed to Thug’s Young Stoner Life record label, scored his second No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart with “DS4Ever” this year.
