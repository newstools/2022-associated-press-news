KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Rwandan authorities on Monday opened the Uganda border to truckers after nearly three years of a tense standoff, but other travelers were held back by immigration officials.In deciding to reopen the border, Rwanda warned in a statement Friday  that “pending issues” must be resolved before relations can be normalized with Uganda. Now Rwandan authorities say travel to Uganda via the land border is restricted to essential travelers until COVID-19 prevention measures are put in place. The decision has disappointed traders in Rwanda and Uganda who had hoped for a return to normal business. Only truckers and Rwandan citizens or returning residents are permitted to cross from Uganda into Rwanda, Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said on Twitter. “You cannot say that you have opened for the trucks alone and then you say you have opened the border. Some of us are even fully vaccinated, then why do you bar us?” said Rwandan trader Charles Mugabo.ADVERTISEMENTRwanda first closed the busy Gatuna border crossing in Feb. 2019, accusing Ugandan authorities of backing rebels opposed to Rwandan President Paul Kagame and demanding the expulsion from Uganda of the business interests of a Rwandan tycoon who is critical of Kagame.
