BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — The president and chief executive officer of the University of Vermont Network, which includes hospitals in Vermont and New York, will retire from the position in September, officials said. Dr. John Brumsted has held the position since the network was founded in 2011, the Burlington Free Press reported. The network includes UVM Medical Center in Burlington; Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin; and Porter Medical Center in Middlebury; Alice Hyde Medical Center in Malone, New York; Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital in Plattsburgh, New York; and Elizabethtown Community Hospital in Elizabethtown, New York.“It is such an honor to be part of health care in Vermont and northern New York,” Brumsted said in a written release. “We have experienced and accomplished so much together, and we created something new — an integrated health care system — to respond to the needs of the patients we are so privileged to serve. We have faced many challenges, and there is no doubt that there will be more challenges in the future.”
