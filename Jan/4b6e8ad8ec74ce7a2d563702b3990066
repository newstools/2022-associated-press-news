Highway 12 between the Basnight Bridge and Rodanthe is closed until further notice, WITN reported. That stretch covers approximately 13 miles (20 km).Work crews will begin clearing the road as soon as conditions allow, the department said.Monday’s severe weather caused flooding and power outages along the coast. Ferry service from the mainland to Ocracoke Island remains suspended.Across North Carolina, the weather that brought high winds and downed trees along with rain and some snow contributed to almost 200,000 utility customers being without power on Monday morning, Gov. Roy Cooper said. The most outages were in the Greensboro, Winston-Salem and Charlotte areas. Duke Energy, the state’s dominant electricity provider, reported fewer than 6,900 outages in North Carolina late Tuesday afternoon, with most in the Triad region. The utility said it expected nearly all power would be restored by midnight.
