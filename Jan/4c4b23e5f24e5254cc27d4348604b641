DALLAS (AP) — Dallas captain Jamie Benn had a goal and an assist two days after coming out of COVID-19 protocols, and the Stars beat the Florida Panthers 6-5 in a shootout Thursday night in their first game in 2 1/2 weeks because of virus issues throughout the team. Joe Pavelski and Jason Robertson scored on the only two shots in the shootout for the Stars while Braden Holtby stopped both Florida shots to end the game. The Panthers left their net empty and had an extra skater on the ice when Jonathan Huberdeau scored with 29 seconds left in regulation to force overtime. Stars defenseman John Klingberg, who had two assists and a goal-saving play, had one final shot that was kicked away by goalie Sergei Bobrovsky with a second left in the five-minute overtime period. Benn was the last of 11 Stars players who had spent time in COVID-19 protocols since their last game Dec. 20. They had six games postponed before finally playing for the first time in 17 days.ADVERTISEMENTFlorida had won its previous four games, all at home, while scoring 24 goals in that span. Benn put Dallas up 5-4 with 13:34 left after Bobrovsky came out of the net to play a puck. But Denis Gurianov picked it off and skated behind the net, drawing the recovering goalie to his right before passing to Benn for a shot from the other side.
