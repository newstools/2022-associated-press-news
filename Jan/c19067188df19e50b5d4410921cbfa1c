Lukito added there are several additional vaccines that are currently in the process of clinical trials to obtain emergency use permits.“We need to give the booster vaccine to maintain vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 infection,” Lukito said at a news conference on Monday.The Health Ministry-run booster program will begin Wednesday and put at the front of the line high-risk populations aged 18 years and above, namely the elderly and groups of immunocompromised individuals, according to a ministry statement. The government has distributed booster shots to medical workers since July of last year.
