USA Luge has been told that Chris Mazdzer is headed to the Olympics.The 2018 silver medalist, who originally thought a 25th-place finish in a World Cup luge race this past weekend had doomed his chances of making the Beijing Games, apparently has qualified for the Olympics for a fourth time.USA Luge was told by the International Luge Federation on Monday morning that it was getting three starting spots for the men’s race at the Games. The FIL has not released the final quotas publicly yet, but three spots for the Americans would mean Mazdzer is going after all.“Man, honestly, relief,” Mazdzer told The Associated Press shortly after being informed by USA Luge. “Incredibly excited. It’s a mixed bag this time around. I had no idea it was going to be this emotionally draining and stressful. It’s relief, honor and excitement.”The Americans already knew that Tucker West and Jonny Gustafson were going to the Games; having the third slot means Mazdzer will join them.ADVERTISEMENTUSA Luge was nominating the team for U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee approval, typically just a formality, on Monday. Summer Britcher, Emily Sweeney and Ashley Farquharson will race in women’s singles, Zack Di Gregorio and Sean Hollander will make their Olympic debuts in doubles, and they’ll be joined by the men’s trio.Winter OlympicsUS Figure Skating picks experience over youth for BeijingUSA Luge says Mazdzer is heading to Beijing GamesBiathlon retirements mean new hopefuls take aim at OlympicsChinese port city reports 41 virus cases, amid mass testingMazdzer was hoping to make it to Beijing in two disciplines, but he and Jayson Terdiman did not qualify in doubles.
