COTTONPORT, La. (AP) — About 1,500 inmates were being moved from a state prison on Thursday because of a fire at a nearby closed waste tire processing plant, Louisiana authorities said. “Due to the large number of prisoners, this will take some time to complete,” Department of Corrections spokesman Ken Pastorick said in a news release from several departments.Fire broke out Sunday at the Cottonport Monofill plant, about 300 yards (275 meters) north of Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in the rural Avoyelles Parish town of Cottonport.It was about 35% contained on Thursday, with firefighting hindered by shifting winds and other problems, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality said.“This is a unique fire due to the remote location and its lack of access to sufficient water supply,” State Fire Marshal Chief H. “Butch” Browning said.He said his office is investigating the fire as well as working on ways to put it out.ADVERTISEMENTWater was being pumped from ponds, heavy equipment was moving dirt to smother flames, and light plants were being set up to let the pumping continue all night, the Department of Environmental Quality said.BusinessSecurity scanners across Europe tied to China govt, militaryEXPLAINER: How sweeping EU rules would curb tech companiesAnalysis: Biden finds inflation overshadows strong economyEXPLAINER: Why fear of 5G halting flights has fadedPastorick said the evacuation was called after winds shifted Thursday, blowing smoke toward the prison.
