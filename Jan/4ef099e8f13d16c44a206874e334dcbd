There are no new COVID-19 cases at the port, the company said.Young Brothers said it sailed uninterrupted to all ports as scheduled, including three trips between the ports of Honolulu and Kahului before the end of this week.ADVERTISEMENTLast week the company said it wouldn’t accept certain items from Honolulu to Kahului, including cars, livestock, hazardous materials and some palletized and loose cargo. The company has since slowly phased in those types of cargo for shipment this week. It’s monitoring staffing levels and updating customers by email.Young Brothers said more than 90% of its team is vaccinated. It has scheduled clinics to offer booster shots to employees.
