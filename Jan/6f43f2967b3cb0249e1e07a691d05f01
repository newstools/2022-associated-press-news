PINEVILLE, La. (AP) — Her father was driving his work truck at 70 mph (113 kph) to a hospital, but a Louisiana New Year’s baby was faster. Isabella Grace Bordelon was born at 12:15 a.m. Jan. 1 on Louisiana Highway 28 in Pineville, news outlets report. The hospital found her healthy, 7 pounds and 11 ounces (3.5 kilograms) and 19.75 inches (50.2 centimeters) long.Amy Bordelon told The Town Talk that her contractions started as she, her husband, Josh, and their two older daughters were getting ready for bed on New Year’s Eve. She thought of waiting but the pain became too strong. She called her mother to come watch the girls while she and her husband headed to the hospital. Their home in Manifest is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the hospital in Alexandria. It was quicker to drive than to call an ambulance.ADVERTISEMENTTheir truck hit a deer.
