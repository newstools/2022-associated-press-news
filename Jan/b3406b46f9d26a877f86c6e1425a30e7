He was well-known for his passion for covering high school and small college sports in central Nebraska and University of Nebraska-Lincoln football.Littler, a native of Deerfield Beach, Florida, graduated from Florida State in 1976. He landed his first TV job as a sports reporter in Huntington, West Virginia. He moved to Ohio and worked at stations in Columbus, Youngstown and Akron before he arrived at KHAS-TV in 1992.ADVERTISEMENTLittler was a fixture at the Nebraska football team’s news conferences and had a cordial relationship with the head coach in the 1990s, Hastings native Tom Osborne.Littler began covering the Cornhuskers as they began their run-up to winning three national championships, a fact Osborne liked to kid him about.“I wish he would have come a little sooner because when he showed up in the early ’90s, we all of a sudden got a lot better,” Osborne said when Littler retired. “So Ed must have been responsible for some of that.”
