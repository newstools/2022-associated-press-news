The 10-year yield “just continues to trudge higher, pricing in a more and more aggressive Federal Reserve,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. “Until over the weekend, I hadn’t seen any speculation about two rate hikes at the March meeting, and now you’re starting to hear that chatter.”ADVERTISEMENTThe Fed is under pressure to curtail inflation, which jumped last month at its fastest pace in nearly 40 years. At the same time, the job market has bounced back, leaving the unemployment rate last month at a pandemic low of 3.9%. That gives the central bank more leeway to rein in the unprecedented support it’s been providing the economy since the pandemic struck.Higher rates could help stem inflation but would also mark an end to the conditions that have put markets in “easy mode” for many investors since early 2020. Higher rates also make shares in high-flying tech companies and other expensive growth stocks less attractive. The sector was the biggest drag on the S&P Tuesday.
