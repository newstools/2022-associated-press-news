Losses in global indexes have mounted this month as rising inflation and the pandemic’s latest surge has caused investors to take caution.The Federal Reserve and other central banks are under pressure to curb inflation after U.S. consumer prices rose last month at their fastest pace in nearly 40 years. At the same time, the U.S. job market has bounced back, leaving the unemployment rate last month at a pandemic low of 3.9%. That gives the Fed more leeway to rein in the unprecedented support it’s been providing the economy since the pandemic struck.ADVERTISEMENTHigher rates could help stem inflation but would also mark an end to the conditions that have put markets in “easy mode” for many investors since early 2020.
