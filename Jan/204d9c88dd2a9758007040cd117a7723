She began her career, aged 14, as an extra in Yesilcam films before landing her first major role in the 1957 film “Leke” or “Stain.” Many of her films were directed by film producer, director and screenwriter Memduh Un, who was her partner until his death in 2015.ADVERTISEMENTIn 1989, Girik was elected mayor of Istanbul’s Sisli district for the now-defunct Social Democratic Populist Party. Girik held the position until 1994. In more recent years, she appeared in several Turkish TV series.Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy described Girik as one of the most “precious names” of Turkish cinema who “left her mark” on Yesilcam. A memorial service was planned for Tuesday in Sisli before her burial in Bodrum, on Turkey’s Aegean coast, where she was based.
