MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A proposed copper-nickel mine in northern Minnesota is facing more legal action.A lawsuit filed Tuesday by several environmental organizations alleges that the PolyMet Mining Corp. project threatens critical habitat for gray wolves, Canada lynx and the northern long-eared bats. They say a wildlife assessment on impacts of the mine is highly flawed and decisions based on the study violate the Endangered Species Act.The 42-page complaint names Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as defendants. Among other things, the environmental groups are seeking to void the June 2018 land exchange between the Forest Service and PolyMet, the Star Tribune reported.ADVERTISEMENTThe suit is the latest of several challenges  to the now-stalled $1 billion mine near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes. PolyMet, based in St. Paul, is majority owned by mining giant Glencore in Switzerland.ScienceNew space telescope reaches final stop million miles outSki resorts aim for more efficient snowmaking amid droughtCalifornia redwood forest returned to native tribal groupUS, Colorado reach proposed settlement in 2015 mine spill The Minnesota Court of Appeals on Monday reversed a decision  by regulators to issue a water quality permit for the project. It now goes back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to determine whether any pollution discharges from the mine into groundwater would violate the federal Clean Water Act. The ruling favored the mining company on most other issues.
