PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Half of Maine’s money from an opioid settlement will go to a recovery fund that will be tasked with making decisions on how to use the funds to mitigate the opioid epidemic in the state.The money is part of Maine’s chunk of a $26 billion settlement with Johnson & Johnson and opioid distributors. Governments around the country sued the companies for their role in the nationwide opioid crisis.Maine stands to get as much as $130 million over 18 years, Attorney General Aaron Frey said. Frey said he has reached an agreement with cities, counties and school districts in the state about the use of the settlement money.Under the agreement, 50% of the money will go to the recovery fund. Another 20% will go to the state, and 30% will go to 39 Maine counties and municipalities that either filed litigation against the companies or that have more than 10,000 residents, Frey said.ADVERTISEMENTThe distribution of the money could start as soon as April, Frey said. He said the distribution of the money “secures represents a significant opportunity to confront the crisis head on.”The crisis in Maine is ongoing. Drug overdose deaths in Maine increased by nearly a quarter in 2021.
