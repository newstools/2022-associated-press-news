SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico’s largest school district says it’s canceling classes due to a cyber attack.Albuquerque Public Schools said Wednesday that it will close all schools in the district on Thursday, for at least one day.“​​The district is working with contracted professionals to fix the problem, and we hope to re-open schools Friday, Jan. 14. However, if the issue isn’t resolved by mid-day Thursday, students, families, and staff will be notified,” said district spokeswoman Monica Armenta.The district serves 20% of the state’s K-12 public school students.The school isn’t planning on going remote, as it has during COVID-19 closures, but instead is treating the cyber attack cancellation as it would a snow day.Albuquerque Public Schools has had fewer in-person learning days during the pandemic due to a later-than-average return to in-person learning last spring. But it wasn’t among the wave of districts that announced COVID-19 closures Tuesday and had been expected to remain open.___Attanasio is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
