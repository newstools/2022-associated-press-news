BOSTON (AP) — Unionized city workers in Boston are raising concerns over a Sunday deadline to get vaccinated against COVID-19, even as most workers have already met the mandate. Firefighters and other unionized public safety workers are continuing to challenge the mandate by Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu in court and in vocal protests. The firefighters union wants the city to provide an option to submit to weekly COVID testing instead of being vaccinated.The city’s largest police union has also opposed the mandate, and the city teachers’ union has  voiced concerns the mandate will disproportionately hurt educators of color. ADVERTISEMENTWu initially set the deadline for Jan. 15, but pushed it back in the face of union opposition. The city’s mandate requires municipal workers receive at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Sunday or face being placed on unpaid leave.Coronavirus pandemicWill virus be 'over'?

That includes 94% of public school workers, 95% of police department staff, 95% of library workers, 97% of parks and recreation workers and 91% of fire department staff.Wu has said her administration is still sifting through more than 600 requests for an exemption based on medical or religious reasons.
