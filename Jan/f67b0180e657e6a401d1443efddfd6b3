Jared Bynum had 18 points, Justin Minaya finished with 13, and Noah Horchler added eight points and 13 rebounds.It was just the second game for St. John’s (9-4, 1-1) since it had four games over 18 days postponed after multiple players were placed in COVID-19 protocols.Dylan Addae-Wusu led the Red Storm with 20 points and Aaron Wheeler finished with 15. But the Red Storm were just 8 of 17 from the free throw line on the day, compared to 26 of 30 for the Friars.Providence struggled early, playing its second straight game without senior guard A.J. Reeves as he continues to deal with an injured finger on his non-shooting hand.

But they settled for far too many outside shots down the stretch and will need to find ways to stay in games defensively to be a factor in the conference.

Watson was assertive on the inside in the second half, a great sign for this team heading into the meat of its conference schedule.
