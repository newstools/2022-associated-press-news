Andy Levin and Haley Stevens currently represent parts of the seat, but they are seeking to represent a new, Democratic district in Oakland County.ADVERTISEMENTThe 40-year-old James, a top GOP recruit, was twice the Republican nominee to challenge incumbent Democratic senators, losing by about 1.7 percentage points to Gary Peters in 2020.Joe BidenJohn James announces run for Michigan congressional seatBiden to meet Qatar leader as Europe energy crisis loomsNorth Korea tests longest-range missile since 2017Biden calls for release of US hostage in AfghanistanThe West Point graduate flew Apache helicopters in combat and led two platoons during the Iraq War.
