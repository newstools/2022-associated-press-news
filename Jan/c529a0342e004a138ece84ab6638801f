Acting coach Darvin Ham, on being back at the site of the playoff thriller: “Great memories, but it’s 2022,” he said. Nets: Durant moved ahead of Patrick Ewing (24,815 points) into 23rd place on the career scoring list. ... Nicolas Claxton and Cam Thomas each scored 14 points.PATTY’S PLACEPatty Mills shot 1 for 8 for three points. He returned to his reserve role when Irving played Wednesday, but was back in the starting lineup again Friday. Coach Steve Nash said the Nets need to keep Mills in the lineup at home while starting swingman Joe Harris is recovering from left ankle surgery.ADVERTISEMENT“I think the Kyrie situation hopefully helps Patty,” Nash said. “I think we’ve seen him kind of almost be overused and over-depended on, and I think it’s been difficult for him at times to be able to continue his level of play because we’ve overburdened him. So, can Kyrie keep his minutes in a sweet spot where he can keep it consistently high level?”COACH’S CHAIRHam, on what it feels like to in the head coach’s seat:“It feels weird and feels intense and I like it, but I also like not being in it at this point in time. Bud makes it look effortless man, but I’ve seen what he goes through being with him since Day 1.” UP NEXTBucks: At Charlotte on Saturday night.Nets: Host San Antonio on Sunday.
