PARIS (AP) — PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino still hopes star striker Kylian Mbappe agrees to a new long-term contract, even though he is now free to sign for another club next season.Mbappe’s contract runs out in June and since the start of January he has been a free agent, meaning he can leave for nothing at the end of the season.“The club knows his situation, our wish is that he stays at the club for several years,” Pochettino said Sunday at a pre-game news conference ahead of Monday’s French Cup game at third-tier Vannes. “We hope that Kylian continues to be just as efficient and that it’s a favorable outcome for everyone.”Last summer, PSG withstood an aggressive bid from Real Madrid  reported to be around 200 million euros ($227 million) for Mbappe, who starred for victorious France at the 2018 World Cup. PSG’s sporting director Leonardo said Mbappe wanted to leave, but the move eventually fell through as Madrid backed away.ADVERTISEMENTMbappe has easily been French league leader PSG’s best player this season, notching nine goals and eight assists in the league  and scoring four goals in the Champions League for a total of 15 goals in 24 games in all competitions.

Mbappe scored four times in an 8-0 rout of Kazakhstan in November.They have combined superbly in recent internationals and pairing Benzema — who has 299 goals overall for Spanish league leader Madrid — with Mbappe would be a tantalizing prospect.Pochettino understands that talk of such a move could prove unsettling, but that Mbappe remains fully focused.“Such a situation can affect you if you don’t have enough maturity,” Pochettino said. “But Kylian has it.”ADVERTISEMENTMeanwhile, Pochettino is uncertain when Lionel Messi will be available to play after the Argentine star tested positive for the coronavirus back home.
