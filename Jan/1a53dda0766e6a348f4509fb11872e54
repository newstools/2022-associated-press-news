(Penguin Press via AP)NEW YORK (AP) — Grant Hill’s path to the NBA Hall of Fame had plenty of pain along with all the highlights. Hill has a deal with Penguin Press for the memoir “Game,” scheduled for June 7 and billed by the publishers as a “full, frank story” covering both the “pinnacle of success” and “the depths of personal trauma.” Hill will tell about helping Duke University win back-to-back NCAA titles, playing on the 1996 Olympics team that won the gold medal, and his achievements with such professional teams as the Detroit Pistons and Orlando Magic. He will also discuss the ankle problems that plagued him for years, and the health struggles of his wife, Tamia Hill, the singer, songwriter and actor who has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.“My journey through basketball provided me with opportunities that I couldn’t imagine when I started playing,” Hill, now co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks, said in a statement Wednesday. “More importantly, I grew and learned more about myself through the moments of athletic and personal adversity. There is connectivity in the stories we share, a familiarity in the collective pursuit of our goals and dreams. I have benefited from the chronicles of many people throughout my life, and I hope that ‘Game’ can be of similar value to others as they chase their dreams and fight through the unavoidable challenges life presents.”ADVERTISEMENT
