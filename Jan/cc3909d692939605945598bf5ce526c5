BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Passenger traffic at North Dakota’s eight commercial airports in November nearly doubled from last year, despite the surging coronavirus. Year-to-date boardings in November were ahead of 2020 at all eight airports in Bismarck, Minot, Williston, Dickinson, Grand Forks, Fargo, Devils Lake and Jamestown. Statewide, they were up about 53%, but down 26% from 2019.According to the state Aeronautics Commission, 83,429 people boarded planes at the eight airports during November. Additional travel demand during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend was reminiscent of pre-pandemic levels, and mild weather limited flight disruptions, according to Aeronautics Commissioner Kyle Wanner, the Bismarck Tribune  reported.
