TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Former New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney sued the Democratic Party’s state chairman on Thursday after being removed from the commission that will draw new legislative districts. Sweeney filed the suit against LeRoy Jones in state superior court in Mercer County.“They removed me illegally,” Sweeney said in a phone interview. “I’m a loyal Democrat. I haven’t acted up.”The lawsuit shows divisions within the Democratic Party in the state between members from the South, where Sweeney hails from, and those from the North. Jones is from Essex County. Jones had the authority to remove Sweeney, according to an email sent from Democratic Party attorney Jonathan Berkon. Berkon did not elaborate on that authority. Steve Sweeney had been one of the Democratic Party’s representatives on the 11-person, bipartisan panel. But Jones said that, in his capacity as the Democratic state party chairperson, he was removing Sweeney, according to a letter Jones sent to the secretary of state Wednesday.ADVERTISEMENTEntertainment'Tiger King' Joe Exotic set for resentencing in OklahomaMajor guilds announce film nominees, clarifying Oscar fieldReview: 'Ice Age' franchise tries spin-off with possums brosFamily says lax security allowed killing of rapper DrakeoNo explanation was given, but Jones said in a statement that the party wanted to include more diverse voices on the panel, known formally as the Apportionment Commission.
