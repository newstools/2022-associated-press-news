FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky lawmakers wrapped up work Friday on extending a pandemic-related provision allowing designated family and friends to visit residents of long-term care facilities.The bill won final passage on a 31-0 vote in the Senate, sending the bipartisan-backed measure to Gov. Andy Beshear. The legislation cleared the House on Thursday.The goal is to prevent long-term care residents from feeling isolated from their families as the COVID-19 pandemic persists. The bill would maintain designated in-person visits in those facilities.“Patient care is not just about medical care,” Sen. Julie Raque Adams, the bill’s lead sponsor, said during an earlier debate. “As we all know, it’s about considering the holistic needs of the individual -- their mental, emotional and spiritual needs.”Under the bill, long-term care residents can designate at least one “essential personal care visitor” to make in-person visits. Visitors could include relatives, legal guardians, friends, caregivers or volunteers. Visitors would have to follow safety protocols of the community or facility.ADVERTISEMENTThe bill also applies to assisted living communities and mental health hospitals.During the earlier debate, Sen. John Schickel referred to it as one of the most important bills that lawmakers will take up in this year’s session.“The people in our long-term care facilities and nursing homes the last year have suffered immensely,” he said.
