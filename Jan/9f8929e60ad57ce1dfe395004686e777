ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Authorities say a man awaiting trial in a drive-by shooting that injured two people near Farmington last year also is facing charges in the fatal shooting of a woman days later northwest of Aztec.Prosecutors said 21-year-old Jaden Ortega remains jailed in San Juan County on suspicion of an open count of murder in the July 30 death of 52-year-old Julie Harris and being a felon in possession of a firearm.. Detectives allegedly have matched the gun shell casings from the July 20 drive-by shooting to those found at the Harris crime scene, the Albuquerque Journal reported Sunday.Police said there were several bullet holes in the front door at Harris’ home and an equal number of 9 mm shell casings outside.According to the Journal, the detective on the Harris murder case also was investigating the earlier drive-by shooting the allegedly involved Ortega.The detective sent the casings recovered in both incidents to the crime lab for comparison and police said the results showed the casings came from the same gun, the Journal reported.It’s was unclear Sunday if Ortega has a lawyer yet who can speak on his behalf.
