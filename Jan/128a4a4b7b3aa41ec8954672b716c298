ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Slovakian skier Petra Vlhova took a big lead in the opening run of women’s World Cup slalom in tough race conditions on Tuesday.Mikaela Shiffrin trailed by more than six-tenths of a second in second place upon her return to competition following a positive COVID-19 test and missing two races last week.Vlhova opened the slalom in 55.99 seconds on the Crveni Spust course, where the soft snow surface and gusts whipping up eddies of leaves made for challenging conditions.“I’m satisfied because I wanted to take advantage from the No. 1,” Vlhova said. “I did it and now it’s going to be a big fight in the second.”Shiffrin, who was only cleared to race on Monday, started seventh and last of the elite group. The American finished .64 seconds behind and was one of only three racers to finish within a second off Vlhova’s lead.Vlhova won the last two editions of the traditional first slalom race of the calendar year. The Slovakian has won 10 of the last 16 slaloms, and three of the four this season.ADVERTISEMENTLast week, Vlhova extended her lead over Shiffrin in the discipline standings to 120 points by winning in Lienz, one of the two races Shiffrin missed while quarantining.Coronavirus pandemicWhy are so many vaccinated people getting COVID-19 lately?In locked down Chinese city, some complain food hard to getOmicron upends return to US schools and workplacesFDA expands Pfizer boosters for more teens as omicron surgesWendy Holdener of Switzerland finished .81 behind and Anna Swenn Larsson of Sweden had .84 to make up in the second leg.
