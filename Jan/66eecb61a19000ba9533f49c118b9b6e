MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — The Manchester NAACP and the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund are launching an effort to deliver financing and coaching to small businesses owned by people of color. The initiative began with interviews with 45 business owners in greater Manchester who identify as black, indigenous, or people of color, about their strengths, struggles, and what their businesses need to succeed.The interviews revealed that the business owners generally were resourceful and resilient and had excellent relationships with their customers. But many said they faced challenges in technology, financing, and bookkeeping. Few felt connected to business institutions, such as banks or industry groups. The pilot program’s goal is to bring people of color together as a community to create a more resilient local economy, the organizations said in a news release. It draws on the work of the Manchester NAACP in advocating for equal economic opportunities, and the Community Loan Fund’s economic development experience.One goal is a Community Business Development Council, a volunteer group of business owners who will identify and refer peers who could benefit from technical assistance and loans.
