BERLIN (AP) — The German economy shrank by 0.7% in last year’s fourth quarter amid a resurgence in coronavirus infections and new restrictions, official figures showed Friday.The quarter-on-quarter decline reported by the Federal Statistical Office followed two quarters of solid gains that came despite persistent supply bottlenecks. Gross domestic product grew 2.8% over the whole of last year, the office said, rebounding from a plunge of 4.6% in 2020 when pandemic lockdowns were at their most severe. That figure was revised up slightly from the preliminary figure of 2.7% the office reported earlier this month.The government this week cut its growth forecast for this year to 3.6%, down from the 4.1% Germany’s previous government forecast in late October. Economy Minister Robert Habeck told parliament on Friday that it expects 2.3% growth in 2023.The first-quarter performance will be “inhibited, above all because of the corona pandemic and the restrictive measures but of course also because of the foreign policy situation — times of crisis are often times in which the investment climate suffers,” Habeck said, alluding to tensions with Russia over Ukraine. “We expect that the pre-crisis level will be reached in this year’s second quarter.”Coronavirus pandemicHow many times can I reuse my N95 mask?COVID hits one of the last uninfected places on the planetJapan to watch WHO probe of director's alleged racism, abuseCases plateauing in parts of India but omicron still surgesADVERTISEMENTGermany is currently seeing another spike in COVID-19 infections fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant.However, on Tuesday, a closely watched survey showed business confidence unexpectedly picking up in January after a six-month slide.
