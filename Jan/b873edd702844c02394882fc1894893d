LONDON (AP) — England will be without its captain and maybe its most likely try-scorer for the start of the Six Nations rugby tournament.Owen Farrell was ruled out of England’s opening game of the tournament against Scotland at Murrayfield on Feb. 5 because of an ankle injury and was replaced in the training squad by George Ford on Monday.That will force coach Eddie Jones to name a new captain. One option could be Courtney Lawes, who led England during the autumn internationals, though the lock is unable to train this week due to concussion so Nick Isiekwe has been called in as a replacement.In another blow, star winger Jonny May was forced to withdraw from the training group because of a knee injury. His place in the 36-man group that gathered in Brighton on Monday was taken by Elliot Daly, who provides cover at wing, fullback and center.May has scored 35 tries for England, putting him second on the country’s all-time list.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
