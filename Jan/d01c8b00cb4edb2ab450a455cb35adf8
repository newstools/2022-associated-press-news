MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian judge who will decide whether top-ranked tennis star Novak Djokovic plays in the Australian Open questioned on Monday what more the Serbian could have done to meet Australia’s coronavirus entry requirements.The 34-year-old is fighting deportation and the cancellation of his visa in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia.The Australian government canceled his visa shortly after he arrived in Melbourne late Wednesday because officials decided he didn’t meet the criteria for an exemption to an entry requirement that all non-citizens be fully vaccinated for COVID-19. Djokovic, who court documents say is unvaccinated, argued he did not need proof of vaccination because he had evidence that he had been infected with the coronavirus last month.Australian medical authorities have ruled that a temporary exemption for the vaccination rule can be provided to people who have been infected with COVID-19 within six months.ADVERTISEMENTCircuit Court Judge Anthony Kelly noted that Djokovic had provided officials at Melbourne’s airport with a medical exemption given him by Tennis Australia, which is organizing the tournament that starts on Jan. 17, and two medical panels.Coronavirus pandemicChicago fight with teachers union stretches into 2nd weekStay home or work sick?

It was not clear where Djokovic relocated to during his hearing. He did not appear on screen in the first hours of the virtual hearing.Lawyers for Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews will make their submission later Monday on why Djokovic should be deported.Djokovic’s lawyers submitted 11 grounds for appeal against his visa cancellation.The lawyers described the cancellation as “seriously illogical,” irrational and legally unreasonable.The virtual hearing crashed several times because of an overwhelming number of people from around the world trying to watch the proceedings.Djokovic is a nine-time Australian Open champion. He has 20 Grand Slam singles titles, a men’s record he shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.___McGuirk reported from Canberra.
