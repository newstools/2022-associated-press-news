ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Travis Lunn, a veteran casino executive, was named Wednesday as the new president of Atlantic City’s Borgata casino.He most recently served as the southeast group president and chief operating officer for MGM Resorts, where he led Beau Rivage Resort & Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, and Gold Strike Casino Resort in Tunica, Mississippi. Lunn succeeds former Borgata president Melonie Johnson, who is returning to MGM’s National Harbor casino as president and chief operating officer, a job she held before joining the Borgata in 2020.The move reduces the number of women in charge of Atlantic City casinos to one; less than a year and a half ago, there were four.

I can’t wait to jump in and connect with all of the employees, guests and local community members.”TravelCDC urges 'up to date' shots; no 'fully vaccinated' changeEXPLAINER: Why was holiday-season flying such a nightmare?Cyprus mandates more testing to check rapid COVID-19 spreadThousands of flights canceled, delayed at start of workweekThe Borgata is Atlantic City’s top-performing casino.
