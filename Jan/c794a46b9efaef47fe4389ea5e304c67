BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia’s president called on Novak Djokovic to return to his native country hours after the top-ranked tennis player lost his court battle to play at the Australian Open on Sunday and was deported.Djokovic’s final destination was not immediately clear. He left the country after saying he was “disappointed” with losing his appeal against deportation and adding that he needs “some time to rest and to recuperate” after the 11-day saga.A masked Djokovic was photographed in an Melbourne airport lounge with two government officials in black uniforms. He left on an Emirates flight to Dubai, the same transit point he used when he flew to Australia on Jan. 6 after departing from Marbella, Spain.Djokovic released a statement shortly after three Australian Federal Court judges unanimously upheld a decision made on Friday by the immigration minister to cancel the 34-year-old Serb’s visa on public interest grounds because he is not vaccinated for COVID-19.ADVERTISEMENTDjokovic’s visa was initially canceled on Jan. 6 by a border official who decided he didn’t qualify for a medical exemption from Australia’s rules for unvaccinated visitors. Djokovic was initially exempted from the tournament’s vaccine rules because he had been infected with the virus within the previous six months.In addition to his native Serbia, where he has an almost iconic status and overwhelming support, Djokovic could go to Marbella or Monaco where he has residences and where he has spent most of his time away from tennis.

It is incredible to me how we have two totally opposed court decisions within just a few days.“As the head of the government of the Republic of Serbia I am not happy, but we should not get too emotional,” Brnabic said. “In any case, I can’t wait to see Novak Djokovic in our country, in Serbia, so we can go through this together and so we can offer support in these difficult moments.”ADVERTISEMENTDjokovic has won nine Australian Open titles, including three in a row, and a total of 20 Grand Slam singles trophies, tied with rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most in the history of men’s tennis.The Serbian tennis association expressed “huge disappointment” and described the decision to deport Djokovic as “political.” “This decision has only deprived the world from watching Novak’s fight for the tenth Australian Open and 21st Grand Slam title,” it said in a statement.____Associated Press writer Jovana Gec contributed.___More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
