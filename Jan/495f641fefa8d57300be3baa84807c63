WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — The Wichita school district is warning parents that temporary school closures may be necessary because so many teachers are out sick with COVID-19. Superintendent Alicia Thompson told parents in an email that the district, which is the state’s largest with 47,000 students, hopes to give parents two to three days’ notice before closing schools. But she said she couldn’t promise decisions won’t be made more quickly, The Wichita Eagle reports.“Based on what we see happening in our district and our community, that notification could be provided one day to take effect the following day,” Thompson said. At least two Kansas districts, including Bonner Springs and El Dorado, already have canceled classes. And virtual learning isn’t an option because of limits that lawmakers put in place last year.ADVERTISEMENTHoping to provide relief to understaffed districts across Kansas, the state board of education voted Wednesday to ease application requirements for substitute teachers.
