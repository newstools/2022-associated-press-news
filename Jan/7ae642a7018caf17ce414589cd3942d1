TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — The Tuscaloosa City Council plans a public hearing in coming days on a proposal to sell alcohol at Coleman Coliseum during University of Alabama basketball games and gymnastic meets. The hearing, set for Tuesday, was scheduled after the university’s concessions company, Levy Premium Foodservice KP, submitted an application to the city for a liquor license, The Tuscaloosa News reported.The Southeastern Conference lifted a ban on alcohol sales in public seating areas of on-campus stadiums in 2019, leaving the final decision to universities. Fans have been asking for alcohol sales, said athletic director Greg Byrne.“We’ve been able to watch the other schools and the reporting we have gotten back from other schools is that alcohol incidents at their games actually go down once they sell because it’s a much more controlled environment,” he told the newspaper.The plan to sell alcohol at campus sporting events involves only men’s basketball, women’s basketball and gymnastics for now. Any sales are still a few weeks away, Byrne said.
