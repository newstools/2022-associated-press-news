Just last month, on Dec. 29, the state broke more than 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, with many more likely not reported.The number of deaths quickly began to rise, with the state breaking 1,000 deaths just a month later on April 15.It took just eight months, until Nov. 12, for the state to record 10,000 COVID-19 related deaths, and another 14 months to cross the 20,000 death threshold. Massachusetts is one of the more vaccinated states in the nation. Vaccines have been shown to reduce hospitalizations and deaths from the disease.By comparison, for the five-year period from 2015-2019, Massachusetts recorded an average of 1,370 deaths annually from influenza and pneumonia combined, according to  statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 20,000 deaths in less than two years puts COVID-19 closer to the top two leading causes of death in Massachusetts — cancer (13,182 in 2019) and heart disease (13,280 in 2019).
