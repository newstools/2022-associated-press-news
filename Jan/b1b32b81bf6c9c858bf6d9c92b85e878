BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) — The Montana State women’s home basketball games slated for Thursday against Idaho and Sunday against Montana have been postponed due to COVID-19 protocols within the Bobcat program, the university said.The Cat-Griz men’s and women’s basketball games had already been moved from Saturday to Sunday because much of MSU’s athletic staff is going to be in Frisco, Texas for Saturday’s FCS national championship football game between Montana State and North Dakota State.The Montana-Montana State men’s basketball game is still scheduled for 5 p.m. Sunday in Bozeman.The Big Sky Conference will allow games that are postponed due to COVID-19 protocols to be rescheduled, Commissioner Tom Wistrcill said Wednesday. Eight Big Sky women’s games  and four men’s games are already listed as being postponed.The conference office will work with schools to reschedule the games, in the order they were missed, as long as neither team would be playing on consecutive days and both teams have a minimum of seven student-athletes and one full-time coach able to participate.The conference office will set the make-up dates. Any postponed games must be made up prior to the last day of scheduled league competition or they will be considered a no-contest, the league said.
