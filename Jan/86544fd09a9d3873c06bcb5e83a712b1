HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney on Wednesday left open the possibility the governor’s emergency powers may be extended under narrow circumstances as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.The Democratic governor’s civil preparedness and public health emergency declarations, which have been extended multiple times since March 2020, are set to expire Feb. 15. “I think there’s a narrow group of things, going forward, where it would be helpful for us to have a little agility to be able to move fast,” said Lamont, referring to tasks such as having to quickly purchase hard-to-get test kits. Meanwhile, the governor said, his chief legal counsel is preparing a list of roughly 10 to 12 of the remaining COVID-related executive orders that state legislators should consider extending.“I’d like to think the legislature will have the opportunity to vote on them or otherwise,” Lamont said.ADVERTISEMENTLooney, also a Democrat, said he can foresee the General Assembly taking up some COVID-related matters and the governor handling more immediate ones.
