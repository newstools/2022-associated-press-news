WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — More than 1,000 staff members in the state’s largest school district are in quarantine because of COVID-19, but currently all Wichita schools are open.The Wichita Eagle reports  that district records show that nearly 14% of the school district’s staff — some 1,033 people — were off because of COVID-19 illnesses or exposure as of Friday. That is up from 912 and 646 in the previous two weeks.Earlier this month, the district had to temporarily close several schools, including one of its high schools, because of staff shortages as the highly contagious omicron variant of the virus spread, But at the moment, the district is keeping all schools open even as the staff absences set a record for the school year.Kansas schools are having enough problems finding teachers that the State Board of Education lowered the standards for substitute teachers earlier this month.ADVERTISEMENTUnlike last year when many Kansas school districts turned to remote learning when virus cases soared, this year schools are opting to close schools temporarily because a new law restricts online learning to no more than 40 hours per student.Coronavirus pandemicRussia's COVID-19 tally hits pandemic record due to omicronBeijing seals off more residential areas, reports 12 casesThousands in Ottawa protest COVID mandates, many rebuked Utah Sen.
