(AP) — The Santa Fe Regional Airport is set to embark on the first phase of a long-planned expansion.The Albuquerque Journal reported Monday that Bradbury Stamm Construction of Albuquerque will officially break ground after the results of a utility survey, which is currently in the process. Construction is anticipated to take 12-14 months.The expansion, with a $21.5 million price tag, will include doubling the terminal size to 14,000 square feet (1,300 square meters) and creating a bigger parking lot. There will also be an expanded baggage claim and a new cafe and gift shop.Airport officials say this is not cosmetics.
