OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine (AP) — The Maine Special Olympics is serving up the Lobster Dip on Old Orchard Beach after a one-year absence.Dippers surged into the ocean in waves every 15 minutes late Saturday morning to ensure social distancing.Last year, the Lobster Dip was renamed the Lobster Roll, and participants were encouraged to roll in the snow, after the traditional event was canceled because of the pandemic. That remained an option this year for those who didn’t want to gather on the beach.The goal of this year’s event, dubbed “Back to the Beach,” was to raise $100,000 for Maine Special Olympics.
