SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Two Utah counties have issued indoor mask mandates amid a record-setting surge of coronavirus cases that has left long testing lines, shortages of monoclonal antibody treatments and strained hospital staff. Salt Lake County health officials made the order Friday, a day after Summit county. Both cover schools and require masks regardless of vaccination status. Utah law allows county governments to overturn mask mandates and the county around Utah’s capital has done so in the past, but Health Department Executive Director Dr. Angela Dunn told the Salt Lake Tribune she doesn’t expect that to happen this time. Republican Aimee Winder Newton tweeted her support for the new mandate, saying the data is clear that “we have some difficult times in the coming weeks.” The rule sends a message that “decreased social contact” is necessary to avoid overwhelming hospitals and keep schools and businesses open, she said.
