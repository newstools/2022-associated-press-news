ESCANABA, Mich. (AP) — A paper mill in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula has agreed to pay nearly $250,000 to settle an investigation of a fish kill in the Escanaba River, state regulators said.A “catastrophic pipe failure” at the Verso Corp. site in Escanaba resulted in a discharge of partially treated wastewater in August 2020, regulators said.The mill generates a pollutant known as “black liquor,” which typically is burned as an energy source, the Michigan environment department said. The river was deprived of oxygen, and fish — pike, bass, walleye and others — were killed for three miles. The Escanaba River runs for 52 miles from Marquette County to Lake Michigan.Verso, based in Miamisburg, Ohio, will pay $244,000 in civil penalties and natural resource damages, the state said.An email seeking comment was sent to the company Thursday.The Escanaba mill has been making paper since 1911.
