In 2017, Alexander stepped down from his executive role but continued working with the Mike Curb Foundation. He also became an active volunteer with agencies including Second Harvest Food Bank, Nashville Rescue Mission, and Room at the Inn. His motto was “give more than you take,” according to his family. ADVERTISEMENTAlexander served on the boards of The Recording Academy and Belmont School of Music, among others. He was a member of the Country Music Association, the Gospel Music Association and the Academy of Country Music.Alexander is survived by two daughters, Lauren Blair Alexander and Helen Victoria Alexander of Nashville; his parents, Honey and Lamar Alexander of Walland; three siblings; and seven nieces and nephews.
