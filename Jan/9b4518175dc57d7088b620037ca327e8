NEW ORLEANS (AP) — New Orleans’ oldest working brewery is selling 12-packs of beer and a poster to benefit an organization of Mardi Gras Indian organizations — neighborhood groups of Black people who make elaborate costumes in a tradition going back to the 1800s. All proceeds of the poster and 12-packs will go to the New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council, officials of Faubourg Brewing Co., which changed its name in 2020 after 113 years as Dixie Beer, said Monday.The council, which represents more than a dozen of the city’s 30 or so tribes, works to preserve Mardi Gras Indian heritage, teach young people about it and collaborate on positive social and community activities. ADVERTISEMENT“The history of the Mardi Gras Indians is the history of New Orleans, and through this partnership, we will be able to tell our story for years to come,” said Bertrand Butler, the council’s founder and executive director.BusinessAs Fed meets, investor angst over rate hikes spooks marketsChina 2008 vs 2022: Richer, stronger, more confrontationalAsian shares mixed in narrow trading ahead of Fed meetingStock investors' nerves tested by inflation, omicron, RussiaThe 12-pack boxes hold the brewery’s flagship lager and are decorated with pictures of three chiefs and a princess in full regalia, including elaborately beaded panels and brightly dyed feathers and plumes.

The $40 poster unveiled by Butler and brewery owner Gayle Benson shows a Mardi Gras Indian with the words “New Orleans Mardi Gras 2022” in a ring behind his headdress and the brewery’s name in smaller type at the bottom.“The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indians are woven into the very fabric of our city’s culture, heritage and community. ... We are not only investing in preserving the history of the Mardi Gras Indians, but also ensuring this vital community element continues for generations to come,” Benson said. Officials said the partnership will grow in future Carnival seasons — the weeks between Epiphany, on Jan. 6, and Mardi Gras, this year on March 1.—-This version of the story corrects the company name from Faubourg Brewery to Faubourg Brewing Co.
