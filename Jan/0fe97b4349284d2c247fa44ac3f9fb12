MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Vermont’s annual Free Ice Fishing Day sponsored by the Department of Fish and Wildlife will be held this year on Jan. 29. On Free Ice Fishing Day, resident and nonresident anglers can ice fish on any Vermont water body that is open to ice fishing without a fishing license.Fish and Wildlife Commissioner Christopher Herrick says ice fishing can be a great way to show people how fun fishing can be. “Showing youngsters or adult new anglers how to jig for perch or how to use tip-ups is rewarding, and it can provide an excellent meal of fresh fish,” Herrick said. “Perhaps best of all — the experience almost always creates fond memories to last a lifetime.”
