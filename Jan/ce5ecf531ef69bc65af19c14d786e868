HOMER, La. (AP) — Christmas trees that went unsold will be given to anglers to sink at their favorite fishing spots in a north Louisiana lake to attract fish. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said it has obtained more than 200 trees from local vendors. It also has a limited number of weights to sink them in Lake Claiborne. People can also bring their own weights, such as concrete cinderblocks, the department said in a news release.The Claiborne Parish Watershed District Commission is co-host of the “Reef Rodeo” from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturday, Jan. 15.The department said any trees not given away will be set out around public fishing piers and existing artificial reefs in the lake.
