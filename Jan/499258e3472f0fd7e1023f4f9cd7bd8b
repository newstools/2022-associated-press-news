Michael Romstad, executive vice president of property management for mall owner Simon Property Group, told The Patriot Ledger for a story Monday that the shooting was “unacceptable.”The mall is adding security features like a K-9 unit, more armed guards and more security cameras, including portable security camera towers outside connected to Simon’s Indianapolis-based intelligence center, he said.ADVERTISEMENTSimon has been working with Braintree Mayor Charles Kokoros and police Chief Mark Dubois.The mall pays for three city police officers to patrol, but the mayor and chief don’t think that’s enough and want Simon to pay for more.Trending newsRihanna is pregnant, debuts bump on stroll with A$AP RockyFaith in the metaverse: A VR quest for community, fellowshipRogan responds to Spotify protest, COVID advisoriesBoris Johnson says sorry after report slams lockdown partiesThe mayor also said the video surveillance system at the mall is “a little bit behind the times,” and would like to see upgrades.In addition to the latest shooting, gang members exchanged gunfire inside a department store at the mall in 2017, and in 2020, a 15-year-old girl described as an innocent bystander was hit twice during a shooting.
