SYDNEY (AP) — England’s Zak Crawley made an attacking half-century but Australia still took three of the 10 wickets it needs as another Ashes test victory looms for the hosts on the final day of the fourth test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Crawley’s enterprising innings was halted at 77 after 13 boundaries when Cameron Green captured the young opener leg before wicket to reduce England to 96-3, after it had earlier lost Haseeb Hameed and Dawid Malan cheaply.Captain Joe Root (13 not out) and Ben Stokes (16 not out) then combined to ease the tourists to the safety of the lunch break at 122-3, still needing 266 runs to win its first test Down Under in over a decade, and Australia requiring seven more wickets. Rain is also forecast for Sydney later Sunday.Needing to bat out the day to draw the test after being set an improbable 388 to win, the tourists lost a very defensive-minded Hameed (9) and Malan (4) in the morning session, but Crawley decided that attack was the best form of defense as he unleashed eight boundaries on his way to a 69-ball half-century.ADVERTISEMENTGreen eventually ended the 23-year-old opener’s innings not long after the morning drinks break trapping him on the crease.
