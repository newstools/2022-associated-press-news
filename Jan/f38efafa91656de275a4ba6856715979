A doctor charged with 11 counts of child sexual abuse involving students at a Missouri boarding school has been given bond in one county but is still awaiting word on whether he will be released from jail.A Greene County Circuit judge on Tuesday set a $250,00 bond for Dr. David Smock, who faces three charges in that county. Judge Ronald Carter also ordered that Smock wear a GPS monitoring device if he is released, The Kansas City Star reported. However, Smock also faces eight charges in Cedar County. A judge in that county has not issued a ruling yet on whether Smock should be released on his own recognizance or receive bond. Smock, 57, has been held in the Greene County Jail in Springfield. ADVERTISEMENTCedar County Sheriff James McCrary previously told The Star that Smock would not be held at his county’s jail because several staff members are related to the doctor or have other connections to him. Smock, 57, pleaded not guilty last week to the Greene County charges, and a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 3.
