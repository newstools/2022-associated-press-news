PARIS (AP) — Brest upset Lille 2-0 on Saturday in the French league to return to winning ways and put an end to the defending champion’s nine-match unbeaten run. The hosts took the lead on their first attack after only three minutes thanks to an own-goal by Tiago Djalo, then withstood Lille’s pressure throughout the match. Striker Steve Mounié guaranteed Brest’s first win this year by adding a second goal from the penalty spot in stoppage time. Lille remained in eighth place, 18 points behind leader Paris Saint-Germain, which hosts Reims on Sunday. Brest moved up to 12th, trailing Lille by four points. Djalo accidentally beat his own goalkeeper as he tried to clear a precise cross from Ronaël Pierre-Gabriel. But the Portuguese defender lost his balance and fired the ball into the top corner instead.American striker Timothy Weah, who has recovered from a quadriceps injury, made his first start since Dec. 1. He created a good chance for Lille just before halftime with a cutback cross for Jonathan David. The Canada striker took his chance with an instant strike and forced goalkeeper Marco Bizot to make a great diving save.ADVERTISEMENTSoccerCity drops points, drone stops play on unusual day in EPLGladbach in crisis after 2-1 loss to Union, Dortmund winsLate Džeko goal sees Inter beat Venezia to go 5 points clearCity's long winning run in EPL ends in 1-1 at SouthamptonLille dominated and pressed hard until the end.
