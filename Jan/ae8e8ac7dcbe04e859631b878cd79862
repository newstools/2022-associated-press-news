Texas finished 5-7 in a season that included the program’s first five-game losing streak since 1956.The Oklahoma City native will be a graduate transfer.

The Longhorns also signed quarterback Maalik Murphy of Gardenia, California, and coach Steve Sarkisian has said the position would be open for competition ahead of the 2022 season.ADVERTISEMENTNebraska lost last season’s starting quarterback when Adrian Martinez transferred to Kansas State.
