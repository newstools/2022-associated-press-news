Las Vegas Raiders interim coach Rich Bisaccia interviewed for the full-time job on Wednesday as owner Mark Davis searches for a coach and general manager to lead the franchise into the future.Bisaccia took over in October when Jon Gruden was forced to resign following the release of old offensive emails and had a 7-5 record in the regular season.The 61-year-old Bisaccia did a good job keeping the Raiders on track through the aftermath of the Gruden ordeal and receiver Henry Ruggs III’s release after being charged with felonies in a fatal DUI crash that killed a 23-year-old woman.Bisaccia, a longtime special teams coordinator in the NFL, earned the support of his players and helped the Raiders win their final four games to make the playoffs for the second time in 19 seasons. Las Vegas was eliminated last Saturday in a 26-19 loss at Cincinnati, but several players including quarterback Derek Carr and star edge rusher Maxx Crosby have publicly backed Bisaccia’s candidacy.ADVERTISEMENTSince 2000, there have been nine interim coaches who were promoted to the full-time job the following season. Those nine coaches combined for a .426 winning percentage with four of them making at least one playoff appearance.NFLWednesday's Sports in BriefHealthy Titans RB Henry will see banged-up Bengals D-lineBears interview 49ers' pro personnel director Carthon for GMNFL asks Nevada court to dismiss lawsuit from Jon GrudenJason Garrett lasted the longest, going 80-64 in nine seasons with Dallas after replacing Wade Phillips in 2010.
