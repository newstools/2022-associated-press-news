LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas has received the first 211,000 of the 1.5 million at-home rapid COVID-19 tests it has requested from federal officials, Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s office announced Monday.In a statement, the governor’s office said the state would begin distributing the tests shortly to be made available free to Arkansas residents. According to the statement, the tests’ cost of about $10 million will be covered by funds already existing in the state’s COVID-19 response budget.The tests will be available at local public libraries, public health offices and other locations, and the National Guard will help deliver the at-home tests.Meantime, Hutchinson has requested $50 million be distributed to hospitals around the state to fund extra beds to be used to help with the surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations. The Arkansas American Rescue Plan Act Steering Committee has approved the request, but the disbursement still requires legislative approval.ADVERTISEMENTThe proposal included adding 98 additional intensive-care unit beds and 167 other hospital beds, all to be dedicated to COVID-19 treatment and funded for timelines of 28-45 days based on the recommendations of the Arkansas Department of Health.Hutchinson created the Arkansas American Rescue Plan Act Steering Committee in 2020 to make recommendations on the distribution of about $1.57 billion in federal funding.
