MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — LOOKAHEAD TO TUESDAYThe high-profile women’s match on Day 2 features current and former U.S. Open champions Emma Raducanu and Sloane Stephens in the first round. Stephens has six WTA tournament titles, including the 2018 U.S. Open title. The 19-year-old Raducanu has just the one title, but it’s a major. “I watched Sloane win the U.S. Open . . . I hit with her last year actually,” Raducanu said in a pre-tournament news conference. “Obviously you don’t win a Grand Slam without being very capable.” Second-seeded Aryna Sabalenka opens against Australia wild-card entry Storm Sanders, and No. 3 Garbine Muguruza opens play on Rod Laver against Clara Burel. In men’s play, second-seeded Daniil Medvedev — now effectively the top seed after Novak Djokovic had his visa canceled and was deported for not being vaccinated against COVID-19 — plays Henri Laaksonen. No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Mikael Ymer in a night match. Andy Murray, a three-time Grand Slam singles winner but a five-time runner-up at Melbourne Park, plays Nikoloz Basilashvili. Murray is coming off his run to the final at last week’s Sydney tournament where he beat two top 25 players — Reilly Opelka and Basilashvili — before losing in the final to top-seeded Aslan Karatsev.Novak DjokovicDjokovic lands in Serbia as questions arise over French OpenOsaka, Nadal advance in Australia after Djokovic flies homeAustralian Open Lookahead: US Open champ Raducanu in action Tennis star's deportation exposes Australian border debateADVERTISEMENTTUESDAY’S FORECASTMostly cloudy, high of 21 Celsius (70 Fahrenheit).MONDAY’S WEATHERMostly cloudy but sunny later in the day, High of 23 C (74 F).MONDAY’S KEY RESULTSWomen’s First Round: No. 1 Ash Barty beat Lesia Tsurenko 6-0, 6-1; defending champion Naomi Osaka beat Maria Osorio 6-3, 6-3; No. 4 Barbora Krejcikova beat Andrea Petkovic 6-2, 6-0; No. 5 Maria Sakkari beat Tatjana Maria 6-4, 7-6 (2); No. 8 Paula Badosa beat Ajla Tomljanovic 6-4, 6-0; Madison Keys beat No. 11 Sofia Kenin 7-6 (2), 7-5; No. 15 Elina Svitolina beat Fiona Ferro 6-1, 7-6 (4); Wang Qiang beat No. 18 Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2; No. 22 Belinda Bencic beat Kristina Mladenovic 6-4, 6-3.
