MONACO (AP) — Monaco has fired coach Niko Kovac with the club sixth in the French league at the mid-season break.Monaco said in a statement Saturday that Kovac was informed of the decision on Thursday during a meeting, adding that reserve team coach Stephane Nado will take over in an interim role for Sunday’s French Cup game at second-tier Quevilly-Rouen.French sports daily L’Equipe reported that Club Brugge coach Philippe Clement will become the new permanent coach. Clement played 333 games, and scored 45 goals, as a defender for Club Brugge before taking charge in June 2019 and winning two Belgian league titles to make it three in a row, after winning with Genk the previous season.Although Monaco has won three of its past four league games, a poor start to the season and a failure to qualify for the Champions League via the August playoffs have cost Kovac.ADVERTISEMENTThe 50-year-old Kovac’s side lost 3-2 on aggregate to Shakhtar Donetsk, despite leading the second leg 2-0 at halftime in Ukraine.Monaco is four points adrift of second-place Nice and third-place Marseille in the Champions League spots for next season.
