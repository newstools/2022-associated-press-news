ABERDEEN, Md. (AP) — Nearly 500 people will need to be retested for COVID-19 after samples from tests they took at Ripken Stadium last week expired by the time they arrived at a lab.A Harford County Health Department spokesperson  told  WJZ-TV that the agency’s primary laboratory experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, so the test samples were sent to a backup lab instead. But the samples had expired before they got there.About 471 saliva samples taken on Jan. 10 for PCR testing were thrown away as a result. Rapid antigen tests taken the same day were not affected.Anyone who needs to be retested can line up at Ripken Stadium and switch on their hazard lights. Once a lot attendant verifies that people were tested at the site Jan. 10, they will be directed to an expedited line for testing.
