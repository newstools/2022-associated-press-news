JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi lawmakers are sending Gov. Tate Reeves a bill that would create a medical marijuana program for people with serious medical conditions.The House and Senate on Wednesday both passed the final version of the measure, Senate Bill 2095. The Republican governor could sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. He has not said what he will do, but legislators passed it by a wide enough margin to override a veto.If it becomes law, as expected, Mississippi would join the majority of states that let people use cannabis for medical reasons.A majority of Mississippi voters approved a medical marijuana initiative in November 2020, but the state Supreme Court invalidated  it six months later by ruling that the state’s initiative process was outdated and the measure was not properly on the ballot.ADVERTISEMENTSince shortly after the court ruling, legislators have been working to create a program that would allow people with conditions such as cancer, AIDS or sickle cell disease to buy marijuana in state-licensed dispensaries. Reeves said he wants tight limits on how much people could buy because he does not want a recreational marijuana program.HealthVaccine mandate to kick in for first wave of health workersEXPLAINER: How COVID tests, isolation will work at OlympicsGerman lawmakers debate possible COVID vaccine mandateEXPLAINER: What's known about 'stealth' version of omicron?The Senate and House passed slightly different versions of a bill this month, with bipartisan support.
