Board Chairman Keith Shumate also said Tracy Murnane, the former director of purchasing, has agreed to repay $11,000.Bell and Tom Stalf, the zoo’s former president and chief executive officer, both resigned last March after an investigation by the newspaper found they allowed relatives to live in houses owned or controlled by the zoo and sought tickets for family members to zoo entertainment events. ADVERTISEMENTForensic auditors found Bell was responsible for nearly $139,000 of the $631,000 in overall losses, while Murnane was responsible for nearly $13,000, the newspaper reported. While the settlement amounts reached with both men fell short of the total estimated losses, Shumate told the newspaper the amounts were a compromise.
