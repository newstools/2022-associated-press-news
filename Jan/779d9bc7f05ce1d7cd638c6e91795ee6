MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama’s state docks agency has bought more than 270 acres (109 hectares) of land in Montgomery to build an intermodal transfer center that will handle shipping containers which go through the post at Mobile. The Alabama Port Authority announced the $2 million purchase from TRUM LLC, an Alabama-based real estate investment group, in a statement Friday. The completed facility will be serviced by CSX Transportation Intermodal, which will provide as much as $12.5 million for the project.The first phase of the work, expected to take as long as two years to complete and estimated at $54 million, will connect inland shippers in the state with the Mobile seaport’s intermodal container transfer center. The statement said the project will generate 2,618 direct and indirect jobs when finished.“This project will provide our shippers cost-competitive transportation services to and from one of the nation’s fastest growth containerized cargo gateways,” said Port Authority director John C. Driscoll.Last month, the state announced an almost $232 million project, funded mostly by Norfolk Southern Corp., that will upgrade rail transportation between the Mobile port and central Alabama.
