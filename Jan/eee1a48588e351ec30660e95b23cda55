COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio’s election chief has COVID-19.Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose began experiencing “very minor” symptoms Sunday evening, spokesperson Rob Nichols said. That would have been about 24 hours after he cast a vote on new state legislative maps as a member of the Ohio Redistricting Commission. He was joined by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and others at that meeting, both of them at times unmasked. LaRose, 42, tested positive Monday using a rapid test. He has postponed public events, but continues to work and says, “I feel fine.”DeWine, 75 with asthma, is not quarantining. His spokesperson Dan Tierney says he was not a close contact, because he and LaRose sat at opposite ends of the expansive hearing room.Ohio House Democratic Leader Allison Russo sat next to LaRose. She said she’s following CDC guidelines for exposure and also has instructed her staff to do so. LaRose, DeWine and Russo are all vaccinated and have received booster shots.
