CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — New Hampshire is a step closer to buying a private psychiatric hospital to better serve children.The Executive Council voted unanimously Wednesday to approve using $13 million in federal funds to buy Hampstead Hospital. The purchase is expected to be completed this spring.Though demand for acute psychiatric care has increased during the pandemic, the state has struggled for years with adults and children routinely waiting for days or weeks in emergency rooms for beds to open at psychiatric hospitals. New Hampshire Public Radio reports that the council also approved a $2.2 million contract for short-term staffing at Hampstead Hospital. Officials said that will allow the hospital to expand its capacity by 10 to 20 beds.
