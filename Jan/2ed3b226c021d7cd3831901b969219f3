It is an honor for me to be able to take up this challenge, with the desire, above all, to help the group and the club achieve their goals. I feel very good and I am very eager to get back to competition.”ADVERTISEMENTBen Arfa will replace Tukey midfielder Yusuf Yacizi, who signed a six-month loan deal with CSKA Moscow.Once regarded as France’s most gifted player, Ben Arfa did not live up to the huge expectations he raised with his exceptional pace and dribbling abilities when he played with Lyon, the club where he was nurtured.SoccerTottenham stages latest-ever comeback to win an EPL game Inter survives scare to overcome Empoli 3-2 in Italian CupVideo review added for CONCACAF World Cup qualifiersUnion Berlin wins derby, knocks Hertha out of German CupA member of “Generation 87,” a group of promising players born in 1987 that included Karim Benzema and Samir Nasri, Ben Arfa struggled after he left Lyon in 2008.Following two seasons in Marseille, he joined Newcastle, where a hard tackle from Manchester City midfielder Nigel De Jong left him with a leg broken in two places.
