MILAN (AP) — Inter Milan failed to score a goal in an Italian league match for the first time in almost a year as it was held to a 0-0 draw at Atalanta in an entertaining game on Sunday.There were plenty of opportunities for both sides but no goals as Inter’s eight-match winning streak in Serie A was brought to an end, giving hope to the teams immediately below the defending champion.Inter moved two points above AC Milan and seven above third-place Napoli.

Cagliari was two points from safety.José Mourinho’s Roma came into the match on the back of two straight losses but thought it had got off to the perfect start when the referee, Lorenzo Maggioni, awarded a penalty in the fourth minute.However, after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor, the referee realized that Cagliari defender Andrea Carboni had got the ball with a great tackle on Nicolò Zaniolo and he rescinded the penalty.VAR was in Roma’s favor later in the half, however, as the referee again went to the monitor and saw that a shot from Oliveira had been blocked by Cagliari defender Dalbert with his arm.Oliveira struck the resulting penalty into the bottom right corner.SoccerSerie A leader Inter Milan held to 0-0 draw at AtalantaReal Madrid tops Athletic 2-0 to win Spanish Super CupAlgeria stunned as African Cup throws up surprises all overFired after 200 days, Benitez never won over Everton fansRoma should have doubled its lead and was almost made to pay for its profligacy six minutes from time but goalkeeper Rui Patrício pulled off a sensational save to push a close-range shot from João Pedro onto the crossbar.IMMEDIATE IMPACTNani had an immediate impact as he provided an assist moments after coming on to help Venezia rescue a 1-1 draw against Empoli.Nani came on for his debut 18 minutes from time and the former Manchester United player set up David Okereke moments later.
