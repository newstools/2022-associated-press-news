BOSTON (AP) — Advocates are pressing House lawmakers to include in a voting rights bill up for debate Thursday a provision that would let voters register and cast ballots on the same day.The House bill aims to write into Massachusetts law a series of early voting options that were temporarily adopted during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.The legislation would allow for the broad use of voting by mail and expand in-person early voting options. Communities would be required to allow early voting during business hours and all weekends during the early-voting period.The bill would also mandate that the incarcerated be informed about their voting rights.Amendments that would add same-day registration to the legislation are up for consideration when the House debates the bill.Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley is among those calling for the House to allow same-day voter registration even as she praised lawmakers for moving forward with the other changes.ADVERTISEMENT“Same-day registration is critical to boosting voter turnout, especially among Black, brown, low-income, and immigrant communities, and arbitrary voter registration deadlines should not be a barrier to exercising the right to vote,” Pressley said in a press release.Coronavirus pandemicWill virus be 'over'?

The Senate bill would let individuals register to vote during early voting periods or on the day of a primary or election. Supporters said the change would bring Massachusetts in line with at least 20 other states and the District of Columbia that already allow same-day registration. To expand in-person voting, the Senate bill would require two weeks — including two weekends — of early in-person voting for biennial state elections and any municipal elections held on the same day. It would allow one week — including one weekend — of early in-person voting for a presidential or state primary and any municipal elections held on the same day.Under the Senate bill cities and towns would also be allowed to opt-in to early voting in person for any local election not held with another election.
