HONOLULU (AP) — Many University of Hawaii classes continue to be held online because the state is experiencing a surge of COVID-19 cases due to the omicron variant.The 10-campus public university said spring courses that were shifted online for the first two weeks of the semester will remain virtual for another week. They will return to in-person or hybrid instruction on Jan. 31. “Even as Hawaii sees record numbers of positive cases, the state’s hospitalization rates are thankfully remaining manageable,” university President David Lassner said in a statement.Lassner urged students and staff to use the additional week as an opportunity to get booster shots if eligible. Vaccination requirements will soon include booster shots for future semesters, or regular testing for those with approved exemptions, Lassner said.
