CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — Bangladesh was 74-2 at lunch Tuesday after being forced to follow on 395 runs behind New Zealand on the third day of the second cricket test.Opener Mohammad Naim showed grit and application in the second innings of his debut test, batting through the morning session while taking only 15 runs from 81 balls. Najmul Hossain Shanto hurried to 29 from 36 balls and was out just before the break, leaving Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque 2 not out.The tourists still trailed by 321 runs at the break.New Zealand enforced the follow on overnight after bowling out Bangladesh for 126 in reply to its first innings of 521-6 declared just on stumps Monday. Trent Boult took 5-43, including his 300th test wicket, joining Richard Hadlee, Daniel Vettori and Tim Southee among the only New Zealanders to reach that mark.The Bangladesh openers survived the new-ball spells of Boult and Southee on Tuesday before Kyle Jamieson gave New Zealand its first wicket of the day in the 14th over, removing Shadman Islam for 21.ADVERTISEMENTShadman flicked at a ball angled down leg and wicketkeeper Tom Blundell took a tumbling catch, diving to his right.SportsFrom north to east, NFL firings begin on day after finalesMiami Dolphins fire coach Brian Flores after 3 seasonsVikings seek new leadership, fire GM Spielman, coach ZimmerBears opt to make sweeping changes, fire GM Pace, coach NagyJamieson had an outstanding debut season in 2021, becoming the fastest New Zealander to 50 wickets. But he has found wickets harder to come by in this series, taking 2-90 in the first test at the Bay Oval and 2-32 in the first innings of this match.After Shadman’s dismissal, Naim and Shanto added 44 in a sound partnership for the second wicket before Neil Wagner struck with lunch a little more than an over away. Wagner has tested Shanto with repeated short-pitched balls and Shanto had been equal to the challenge, hooking Wagner for two boundaries in the 25th over.Wagner persisted with the short length and Shanto hooked a ball wide of leg stump directly to Boult at fine leg.On Monday Tom Latham made 252, Devon Conway banked another century and Ross Taylor likely played his last test innings as New Zealand declared its first innings midway through the second session of the second day. The home side then bowled out Bangladesh in 41.2 overs before stumps to take its 395-run first-innings lead.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
