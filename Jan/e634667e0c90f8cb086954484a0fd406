CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Thousands of Nevadans will share in a big settlement 39 state attorneys general negotiated with a major student loan collecting company accused of abusive lending practices tied to more than $1 billion in loans, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said Friday.Navient agreed to cancel $1.7 billion in debt owed by more than 66,000 borrowers across the U.S. and pay more than $140 million in other penalties, under the deal first disclosed on Thursday.Ford says 3,952 federal loan borrowers in Nevada will receive a total of $1.05 million in restitution and 592 Nevada borrowers will receive private loan debt cancellations totaling more than $17 million.The deal resolves claims dating to 2009 when Navient began steering struggling student loan borrowers into costly terms instead of counseling them about more affordable income-driven repayment plans, Ford said.ADVERTISEMENT“This settlement provides relief to thousands of Nevada students who were victims to Navient’s misrepresentations and predatory practices,” he said. He said it “also serves as a caution to other loan servicers that these practices will not be tolerated, and it is their responsibility to assist borrowers in an honest and professional manner.”
