PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine Gov. Janet Mills has convinced the White House to increase shipments of a key COVID-19 treatment after the number of doses was reduced.Mills announced Monday that the federal government will nearly double Maine’s ration to 120 courses of the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab, the Portland Press Herald reported.A previous reduction in shipments coincided with an artificially low seven-day average of confirmed new cases as the state deals with a backlog of 46,000 positive tests that have yet to be confirmed.“The administration is pleased that the federal government has made this change at a time when its own experts, including Dr. (Anthony) Fauci, are saying that case counts should become less of a focus,” the governor’s office said in a statement.ADVERTISEMENTFor the past week, Maine’s official per capita new confirmed case numbers have been the lowest in the country. But those numbers didn’t account for tens of thousands of backlogged positive tests awaiting confirmation.According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it rations the drug based on state data on COVID-19 hospitalizations and new cases over the previous seven days.
