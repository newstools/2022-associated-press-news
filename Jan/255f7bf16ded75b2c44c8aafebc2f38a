VIENNA (AP) — Austria will subsidize household energy costs with a 1.7-billion-euro ($1.9-billion) relief package to offset rising prices, Chancellor Karl Nehammer announced on Friday.The relief package consists of both direct subsidies and tax suspensions.Almost half will be spent on suspending an “eco-tax” introduced in 2012 that amounted to about roughly 33 euros per year in 2016.At the same time the government will hand out a one-time payment of 300 euros to jobless people, twice the sum agreed upon last December.According to the Austrian Energy Agency, prices for domestic fuel oil have risen 44.3% compared to last year, while diesel fuel has jumped 33.9%. Electricity prices are up 12.4 %.
