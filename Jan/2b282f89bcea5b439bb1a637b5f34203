COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Gov. Henry McMaster is expected in his State of the State address Wednesday to say South Carolina needs to be bold and seize opportunities  created by billions of additional budget dollars to continue to be a great state for businesses.McMaster is set to speak to lawmakers at 7 p.m. at the Statehouse. The annual speech will be carried live by SCETV on its over-the-air channels and streamed on its website.The speech is a chance for the Republican governor to tout what he sees as his accomplishments from last year, likely to include a new law that bans most abortions in the state. That law has been suspended as the courts review its constitutionality.ADVERTISEMENTMcMaster also is expected to set out his goals for 2022, many of which he has already revealed in news conferences late last year or in his budget proposal  to the General Assembly earlier this month. The state has more than $5 billion extra to spend this year because of a booming economy, money saved in past years and federal COVID-19 relief.BusinessEXPLAINER: Are Turkey's efforts to fix the economy working?Airlines worldwide rush to change flights over US 5G problemEXPLAINER: Why airlines fear 5G will upend travel this weekTurkey's deal with UAE to build foreign exchange reservesMcMaster’s office promoted his speech on Twitter  with a video that says the governor wants South Carolina “to blast off” by cutting taxes, making college more affordable and “supercharging our infrastructure.”“If we seize this moment, by thinking big by being bold we can set our state on a course that will provide the opportunity for prosperity, success and happiness for generations of South Carolinians to come,” McMaster said on the video.The Democratic response to the governor’s speech will be given by Rep. Spencer Wetmore, an attorney from Folly Beach. She was city administrator for her hometown before being elected to the House in August 2020.Wetmore said she is ready to outline a different vision for South Carolina from Republicans.“It’s time we take action for the working families of South Carolina instead of paying lip service to extremist politics,” Wetmore said in a statement released by South Carolina House Democrats.___Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP.
