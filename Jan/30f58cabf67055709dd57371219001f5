GAROUA, Cameroon (AP) — Mohamed Salah squeezed a volley under the goalkeeper to give a nervous Egypt a 1-0 win over tiny Guinea-Bissau, which was denied maybe its biggest result at the African Cup of Nations on Saturday when it had a brilliant late equalizer contentiously disallowed after a VAR check.Salah’s breakthrough came in the 69th minute after the record seven-time African champion labored to break down Guinea-Bissau.But the Liverpool forward’s smart finish with his left foot from a tight angle wasn’t nearly the most dramatic moment of the game.Guinea-Bissau forward Mama Baldé weaved in from the left wing and unleashed a shot that flew into the far corner of the net with eight minutes to go to seemingly stun Egypt, and the entire tournament in Cameroon.But after a long delay, referee Pacifique Ndabihawenimana of Burundi went over to consult VAR and eventually disallowed the goal for a foul by Baldé on Egypt defender Omar Kamal.Baldé had put a hand on Kamal’s shoulder as he forced his way past him on the way to scoring, but it was a tight, tight call.Egypt survived another scare from a shot by Moreto Cassamá in what was just about the last kick of the game.ADVERTISEMENTThe victory revived Egypt’s Group D campaign after it lost its opening game to Nigeria 1-0. Still, it was not the convincing reaction Egypt fans demanded and there was increasing pressure on coach Carlos Queiroz, the former Real Madrid boss.SoccerSalah scores, Egypt escapes with 1-0 win at African CupCoutinho nets late on debut, earns Villa 2-2 draw with Man U70,000 tickets allocated for women’s clásico at Camp NouMATCHDAY: Liverpool eyes second place, Inter faces AtalantaIn stark contrast to Egypt’s struggles, group rival Nigeria eased into the knockout stages earlier with a comfortable 3-1 win over Sudan.

The team also parted ways with coach Gernot Rohr last month and gave the reins to interim coach Augustine Eguavoen, who won the African Cup with Nigeria as a player in 1994.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
