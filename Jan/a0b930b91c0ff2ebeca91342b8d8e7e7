AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Maine might start prohibiting utilities from suddenly disconnecting service to public safety facilities.A proposal from Democratic Rep. Seth Berry of Bowdoinham would require public utilities to give 60 days advance written notice to the facilities of their intent to end service. The utilities would also have to get authorization from state authorities first.Berry said the new law is needed to protect vital public safety equipment used on ambulances and fire trucks.The proposal was the subject of a public hearing before a legislative committee on Jan. 25. More action in committee is expected in the coming week.Central Maine Power, the largest utility in Maine, testified about the bill, but did not take a stance for or against it. Company vice president Linda Ball said the utility “is fully committed to not disconnecting municipal accounts unless requested by our customer.”
