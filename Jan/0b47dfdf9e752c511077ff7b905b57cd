WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s former president and former Solidarity pro-democracy movement leader, Lech Walesa, said Friday that he has COVID-19. The 78-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate said on Twitter that he was surprised to find out he is infected despite the three vaccination doses he has received. “I can’t believe it: I received 3 shot, .... (but) I’m infected. (I have a) headache, I can’t warm up my body. I feel like my flesh is tearing away from the bones,” Walesa wrote.“After this painful lesson I will never separate from my mask,” Walesa wrote.Walesa was fitted with a pacemaker in 2008 and last year he had a heart surgery. In the 1980s, Walesa led the nationwide Solidarity movement that eventually toppled Poland’s communist leaders. He served as democratic Poland’s first popularly elected president in 1990-95. Walesa is a strong critic of Poland’s current right-wing government. ___Follow all AP stories on the pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic.
