LAS VEGAS (AP) — Thousands of revelers who turned out in Las Vegas for New Year’s celebrations were eventually rewarded with a huge fireworks show that had been delayed because of gusty winds.Officials had been expecting huge crowds to turn up for the city’s New Year’s Eve event, including a fireworks show on the Strip that was canceled last year due to the pandemic.But strong winds, which the National Weather Service forecast could gust up to 45 mph, put a damper on celebrations, delaying the show and for a time threatening to cancel it. The eight-minute, choreographed pyrotechnic display was scheduled to be shot from atop eight resort properties and be accompanied by a soundtrack airing on two FM radio stations.The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that sustained winds of 10 mph would prompt the delay of the show, which would have been canceled if winds hadn’t died down by 1 a.m. The fireworks started around midnight. This year’s event was being held despite surging coronavirus cases.In the Las Vegas area, officials said Friday that 3,363 new cases had been reported a day earlier. The spike broke the Southern Nevada Health District’s previous record for the most cases reported in a single day.
