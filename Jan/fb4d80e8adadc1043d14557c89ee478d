BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Real Madrid hosts Valencia on Saturday aiming to bounce back from its first loss in three months and protect its now diminished lead of the Spanish league.Madrid had gone unbeaten in 15 games across all competitions, including 12 in the domestic league, until it stumbled at Getafe last round. The 1-0 loss at its humble crosstown rival allowed Sevilla to pull to within five points with one more game to play than the front-runners.Madrid will face a Valencia team that had gone nine games overall without losing until it was stunned by Espanyol’s two late goals to fall 2-1 at its Mestalla Stadium.Carlo Ancelotti rested striker Karim Benzema, who leads the league with 15 goals, and Luka Modric for Wednesday’s 3-1 win at Alcoyano in the Copa del Rey. The Madrid coach said that his two stars had both finished the Getafe game with unidentified physical issues.ADVERTISEMENTAncelotti, who had chastised his players’ lack of effort against Getafe, said he was pleased with their professional attitude at a third-tier opponent in the cup.“This was not our type of game because it is not possible for your true talent to show,” Ancelotti said about the win. “(But) we showed that we are a team that plays well and today could get down and fight. That is the way it had to be. I repeat: if you don’t fight, you lose.”SoccerPSG relying on Mbappe's scoring ahead of Lyon gameCOVID outbreak at Man City; 4 Serie A games scrappedGuardiola, Tuchel, Mancini up for FIFA best coach awardAubameyang positive for virus on arrival at African CupMadrid has recovered most of its players from a spate of COVID-19 infections.
