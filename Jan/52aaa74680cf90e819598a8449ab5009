TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s Emperor Naruhito offered prayers for those who died during the pandemic, taking to video for the second straight year for his New Year’s greeting on Saturday, having canceled public palace gatherings to curb coronavirus infections. Sitting before a bonsai tree with his wife Masako, Naruhito praised and thanked doctors and other health care workers, and expressed concern for countries lacking access to vaccines and adequate hospital systems.“By treasuring more than ever the connections among people, sharing our pain and supporting each other, I hope from the bottom of my heart that we will overcome these hard times,” he said.Japan has recorded more than 18,000 COVID-19-related deaths, but the pace of deaths has fallen in recent months. Naruhito also voiced worries about the fast-spreading omicron variant. Before the pandemic, the imperial palace in central Tokyo would open at the start of each year to cheering, flag-waving crowds.ADVERTISEMENTThe emperor does not have political power but he carries symbolic significance for Japan and is fairly popular.

The Tokyo Olympic Games, delayed from 2020 due to the pandemic, were one bright spot of “courage and hope,” he added.
