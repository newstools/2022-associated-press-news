Not only do NFL fans get three night games to savor during wild-card weekend, but they also can revel in the rivalries.AFC East foes New England and Buffalo, who split victories on the road during the season. NFC West opponents Arizona and the Los Angeles Rams, who also went 1-1 against each other. Plus San Francisco and Dallas rekindling one of the great postseason series of bygone days, particularly in the 1980s and ’90s. “I’m damn fired up, man,” Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. “Are you kidding me? The early ’90s Dallas-Niners, some of the championship games, for me, coming up and watching those ones, I can hear (John) Madden and (Pat) Summerall talking it through. My first Dallas and Niner playoff game, I’m pretty fired up to do it man. It’s exciting.”It’s also a difficult matchup to handicap. The Cowboys are the more dynamic side, and the 49ers are the more physical group. Dallas prefers to face opponents built more in its image, and San Francisco most definitely isn’t. ADVERTISEMENTDallas has some big-time playmakers on defense who will need to clamp down on All-Pro Deebo Samuel, George Kittle and a solid rushing attack. If All-Pro cornerback Trevon Diggs can work his magic with an interception and DeMarcus Lawrence can get pressure on Jimmy Garoppolo, the Cowboys could be in business.NFLUncertain futures add to sense of urgency for Rodgers, Adams49ers, Cowboys renew playoff rivalry after 27-year hiatusIowa All-America C Tyler Linderbaum declares for NFL draftSteelers fans add winning feat after Carlson's clutch kickBut the Niners are more powerful in the trenches.The 49ers, ranked 10th in the AP Pro32, needed a brilliant rally and overtime against the Rams — talk about archrivals — just to make the playoff field. The No. 5 Cowboys cruised through the NFC East, but have endured enough inconsistency to make you wonder about their staying power. Dallas is a 3 1/2-point favorite at home.
