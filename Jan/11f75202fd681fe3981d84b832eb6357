CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina career coach has received a two-year prison sentence after her conviction for stealing $68,000 from a federally funded workforce development program and using it for herself, authorities said.Dena J. King, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, said in a news release that Jessica Anne Miller, 39, of Hickory was sentenced on Thursday on a wire fraud charge.According to court documents and a sentencing hearing, between July 2016 to November 2019, Miller worked as a career coach for a group contracted by a nonprofit association of local governments. She was to provide training to job seekers, using federal funds made available by the U.S. Department of Labor. Miller previously admitted in court that she engaged in a scheme to divert federal funds to herself by creating fraudulent documents, falsifying signatures, and making false and misleading statements to people who were supposed to get the money. In some instances, Miller created fraudulent documents for mileage reimbursement on behalf of students enrolled in the program, and then cashed the checks and kept the proceeds for herself.
