MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Open champion Naomi Osaka opened her 2022 season with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over Alize Cornet on Tuesday in one of the so-called Summer Set of tournaments in Melbourne.Osaka returned to Rod Laver Arena for the first time since winning the Australian title last February. It was her first tour-level match since a third-round loss to Leylah Fernandez at the U.S. Open in September. Osaka was up a set and a break before Cornet went on a five-game roll to force the match into a third set. The former No. 1-ranked Osaka got just over 38% of her first serves into play, had eight double-faults and 57 unforced errors, but countered that with 51 winners. She faced only three break points in a match that lasted just over two hours.“I feel like I made a lot of unforced errors today,” top-seeded Osaka said, “but I expected that because it is the first match and I was really nervous.”ADVERTISEMENTTravel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic mean there’s a crammed schedule of events Down Under before the Australian Open starts Jan. 17.There are three events being played this week in Melbourne as part of Tennis Australia’s “Summer Set” of tournaments — two WTA tournaments and one ATP.
