The agency has also been plagued by violence, including a spate of inmates killed during altercations with fellow prisoners in November and December. Carvajal’s resignation followed calls from Democratic lawmakers for his removal, including the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Several congressional committees had also been looking into Carvajal and the Bureau of Prisons, questioning employees about misconduct allegations.Carvajal is expected to remain as director in an interim capacity until his successor is named. It is unclear how long that process will take.___On Twitter, follow Michael Balsamo at twitter.com/mikebalsamo1 and Michael Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak.
