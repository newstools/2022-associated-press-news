KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) — A juvenile harbor seal has forgone life in the ocean, instead choosing a home nearly 100 miles up the Hudson River — behavior that wildlife officials called “unprecedented.”The animal was likely abandoned as a pup by his mother in Maine, officials say. A Connecticut rescue center cared for him, then released him in Rhode Island in early 2019 with an electronic tracking tag. By that August, he’d settled down on the Hudson near Saugerties Lighthouse, under the watchful eye of the lighthouse keeper, staying for 620 days.“It is a story like none we have ever heard of … a marine mammal showing such extended affinity and fidelity to freshwater,” said Tom Lake of the state Department of Environmental Conservation’s Hudson River Almanac, The Daily Freeman reported Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTBut the seal’s life on the river had one interruption. Harbor Seal No. 246 — as he’s known officially — disappeared last April, leaving wildlife officials stumped for months.Turns out he needed rescuing again, catching an infection and a skin condition called “seal pox” after swimming down to Long Island’s Atlantic Beach.OdditiesTreasure hunters sue for records on FBI's Civil War gold digLawmaker apologizes after apparent try to 'pants' refereeDogs to visit 3 school districts to sniff out COVID-19Seal skips ocean, makes home 100 miles up Hudson RiverThankfully, Seal 246 was picked up by the New York Marine Rescue Center.
