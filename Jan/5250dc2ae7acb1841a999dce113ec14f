FARGO, N.D. (AP) — The City of Fargo and the municipal board that governs the community’s airport are signing an agreement Monday that gives the airport more autonomy. Formal negotiations have gone on for more than two years and at times have been contentious. The city and the Hector International Airport Authority are signing a memorandum of understanding that changes the 50-year agreement between the two, although they will not completely sever. “The relationship doesn’t mean a complete separation, though,” said former City attorney Erik Johnson, who stepped down from his job last month. “The Airport Authority is sort of an arm of the City in the sense that the City Commission still appoints all five members of the Airport Commission. So, those are significant roles.” The airport authority will take over services currently provided by the city, including those related to finances, information services, payroll and other human resource services.ADVERTISEMENTAnd, airport employees are no longer considered to be city employees, KFGO reported. The City Commission will report detailed information to the city regarding its financial management, audit and safety programs.
