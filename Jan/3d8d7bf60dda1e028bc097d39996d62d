Larry Hogan is scheduled to go on trial in June on charges of misconduct in office and illegally recording conversations.The Baltimore Sun reports that Anne Arundel County Circuit Court Judge Stacy McCormack set Roy McGrath’s trial or June 7 during a hearing Friday in Annapolis. McGrath, his attorney and the prosecutor all called into the hearing on a conference call.McGrath spent 11 weeks in the summer of 2020 as chief of staff to Hogan, a Republican. McGrath resigned after The Sun reported he had negotiated an exit package worth one year’s salary of more than $233,000 and other perks from a state environmental agency when he joined Hogan’s State House team.McGrath has maintained that the payment, which he called “severance,” was proper. Members of the Maryland Environmental Service’s board of directors have testified that McGrath led them to believe Hogan approved of the severance.
