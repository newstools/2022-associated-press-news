WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) — A now-closed Catholic school in Massachusetts has been sold for $4.75 million to a nonprofit that plans to build a three-story senior living apartment complex on the site.Goddard Homestead closed on the nearly 24-acre (9.7-hectare) former St. Peter-Marian Junior Senior High School campus in Worcester in December, Executive Director Joan Cusson told The Telegram & Gazette. The project is scheduled to open for residency by late 2024.The development team received unanimous approvals from the city’s Zoning Board of Appeals, Planning Board and Conservation Commission.The development plan is to build 158 senior living apartments for adults older than 55 in a 150,000-square-foot (13,900-square-meter) building. Of the apartments, 110 will be supportive independent living, 16 will be assisted living and 32 will be memory support.Cusson said an estimate for building costs on the new property could be in the $50 million to $60 million range. Rental prices have not been finalized, but Cusson said the nonprofit plans to keep prices in line with their mission of serving moderate-income seniors.
