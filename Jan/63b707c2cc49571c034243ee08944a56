ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Mikaela Shiffrin is set to return to the women’s World Cup at a slalom on Tuesday, eight days after a positive COVID-19 test that forced her out of two technical races in Austria last week.Shiffrin had a negative test on Monday afternoon before the American’s name appeared on the official start list for the race released by the International Ski Federation.“See you tomorrow, Zagreb,” Shiffrin wrote on Instagram.Shiffrin, who has won the event four times since 2013, will wear bib No. 7. The first run starts at 12:30 p.m. local time (1130 GMT); the second run at 4:05 p.m. (1505 GMT), and this course will be set by Shiffrin’s coach, Mike Day.However, Shiffrin’s American teammate, Nina O’Brien, is among a group of racers missing Tuesday’s race as the coronavirus is increasingly affecting the women’s circuit, less than five weeks before the Beijing Olympics.ADVERTISEMENTThe group sidelined for Tuesday’s race also includes at least three Swiss skiers -- Camille Rast, Aline Danioth and Mélanie Meillard -- as well as two Austrians, a Norwegian, and an Italian.Coronavirus pandemicPentagon chief Austin says he has tested positive for COVIDPrime Minister Morrison upbeat amid Australia virus surgeReport paints grim picture of Chicago-area gun deathsBritish PM: Health service under strain, but no new measuresOne of the Austrians, Franziska Gritsch, said in November it was her “personal decision” not to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.
