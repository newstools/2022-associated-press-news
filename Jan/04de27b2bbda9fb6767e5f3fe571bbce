OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The three-day average number of hospitalizations due to the coronavirus in Oklahoma has topped 1,000 for the first time in three months as the omicron variant has become the dominant strain in the state.The three-day average number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 stood at 1,015 on Tuesday, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, surpassing 1,000 for the first time since early October, but still below January 2021 highs. Oklahoma Hospital Association President Patti Davis said that while the number of COVID-19 patients has not reached the previous peak, the trend of rising hospitalizations is concerning.“Our hospitals are very full, and they’re full of patients that have other conditions (than COVID-19) and they need to be in the hospital” also, Davis said during a Tuesday news conference.The health department said the highly contagious omicron variant now accounts for 57% of the state’s coronavirus cases and health officials say more than 90% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated.ADVERTISEMENTCoronavirus pandemicCOVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicronIn Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots
