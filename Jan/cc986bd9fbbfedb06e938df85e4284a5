Arkansas’ COVID-19 hospitalizations on Monday dropped by five to 1,715. The state’s hospitalizations last week had hit record levels, fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus.The state reported 8,698 new coronavirus cases and 12 new COVID-19 deaths Monday, including figures from over the weekend. The actual number of new cases is likely higher due to the number of people testing at home or who are infected but haven’t been tested.
