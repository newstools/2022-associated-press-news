An art installation inspired by Vice President Kamala Harris, The New York Times’ “The 1619 Project” and “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” as well as charitable programs from Airbnb, Google, PayPal and the National Football League, are among the finalists for the inaugural Anthem Awards announced Tuesday.The awards — presented by The International Academy of Digital Arts & Science, best-known for the internet honors The Webbys — are intended to celebrate the mission-driven work and social impact of individuals, corporations and organizations. The winners, to be announced Feb. 15, will be honored at a virtual awards show on Feb. 28 in conjunction with the first Anthem Voices conference to showcase the winners’ work and share philanthropic and social impact ideas.“By recognizing and highlighting purpose- and mission-driven work, we can amplify the impact of those programs,” said Jessica Lauretti, managing director of The Anthem Awards. “We can also bring folks together for collaboration and partnership and ultimately inspire folks to make a positive social impact in their own communities.”ADVERTISEMENTLike The Webbys, which sought to celebrate the shift to a digital-driven culture 25 years ago, The Anthem Awards aim to capture the current shift to more philanthropic and socially conscious concerns, Lauretti said. The co-founders of the awards include the Ad Council, Born This Way Foundation, Feeding America, GLAAD, Mozilla, NAACP, National Resources Defense Council, WWF and XQ Institute.EntertainmentGrace Kelly's granddaughter appears on horseback for Chanel‘Aftershock’ puts human face to maternal health crisis in USInspired by her mother, Isabel Allende publishes 'Violeta'At Sundance, documentaries resurrect lost eras of music“That old way of doing things. where you would do something over here and then do something over there to make up for it, is done,” Lauretti said. “Now, we’re really seeing the integration of that work and really making it a part of your mission in a way that is authentic and make sense.”A team of judges included actors Daniel Dae Kim and Ashley Judd, GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis, New Ventures CEO and former Secretary of Labor Alexis M.
