No running back has been more productive in the league since Week 14 than Penny, rolling up 481 yards rushing during that stretch, including a career-best 170 last week against Detroit. Arizona is 11th in the league against the run so this will be one of the better tests Penny has faced.

Wesley played for current Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury when both were at Texas Tech and the two were reunited when Kingsbury gave the 6-foot-4, 206-pound his first NFL playing time.KEY MATCHUP: The Cardinals’ defense must try to stop another quality back in Penny, who has thrived over the past few weeks. Arizona’s success stopping the run has been up-and-down throughout the season, but the unit was very good against the Cowboys and Ezekiel Elliott last week, holding him to 16 yards.KEY INJURIES: Seattle placed RB Alex Collins (abdomen) on injured reserve this week ending his season. Collins was Seattle’s leading rusher until Penny’s big game last week. ... Star LB Bobby Wagner suffered a knee sprain last week and seems unlikely to play. ... TE Will Dissly is dealing with a heel injury. SERIES NOTES: The Seahawks have dropped three of their past four games against the Cardinals, including a 23-13 setback earlier this season. In that game, Arizona backup quarterback Colt McCoy had one of the best games of his career in place of injured starter Kyler Murray, completing 35 of 44 passes for 328 yards and two touchdowns.STATS AND STUFF: Arizona is trying for its first season sweep over Seattle since 2009. ... If the Cardinals beat the Seahawks and the 49ers beat the Rams, the Cardinals will win the NFC West for the first time since 2015.

Metcalf needs one TD catch to reach 30 in his first three seasons combined. ...
