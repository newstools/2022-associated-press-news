This brings the state’s total number of cases since the pandemic began to 1,491,420. The death toll remains 24,773.The soaring number of cases is evidence of how contagious the omicron variant is. It has already become dominant in many countries. It also more easily infects those who have been vaccinated or had previously been infected by prior versions of the virus.
