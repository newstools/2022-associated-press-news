LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Winter is still nearly two months away from ending but Lawrence already is gearing up for swim season as it tries to prevent the kind of lifeguard shortage that delayed pool openings last year. The Lawrence Journal-World reports  that Aquatics Supervisor Lori Madaus said the city was only able to fill 60 of the 100 lifeguard positions it needed last year to have the two city pools fully operational. The Outdoor Aquatic Center opened a couple of weeks later than usual last year, with reduced hours and features, and the Indoor Aquatic Center continues to have reduced hours and the children’s swim area remains closed.That’s why that the city started hiring for summer lifeguards at the beginning of January, which is about a month earlier than usual. The minimum pay also has been increased by $1 per hour since last year.“We all want to be open just as much as everybody else, so that’s why we’re trying to get this push a little bit earlier,” Madaus said.
