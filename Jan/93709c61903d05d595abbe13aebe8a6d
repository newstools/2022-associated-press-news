TURIN, Italy (AP) — It’s taken five months but Juventus has finally found a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo.Coveted striker Dušan Vlahović completed a 70-million-euro ($80-million) transfer from Fiorentina on Friday on his 22nd birthday and will wear the No. 7 shirt vacated by Ronaldo.Juventus’ tweet announcing the move included the hashtag “DV7” — a take on Ronaldo’s “CR7.” Vlahović wore No. 9 for Fiorentina.Juventus said Vlahović signed a deal through June 2026 and that the transfer fee also could include up to 10 million euros ($11 million) in bonuses.Vlahović has scored 20 goals in 24 matches in all competitions for Fiorentina this season and is joint top of the Serie A scoring charts, along with Lazio’s Ciro Immobile.ADVERTISEMENTIn fifth place, Juventus had struggled to replace Ronaldo since his move to Manchester United in August. The Bianconeri have scored only 34 goals this season — fewer than any of the top 10 teams in the Italian league, apart from Torino.Vlahović, a Serbia international, could be the perfect player to change that, having just matched Ronaldo’s feat of scoring 33 league goals in a calendar year.SoccerDV7: Juventus finds its replacement for Ronaldo in Vlahović MATCHDAY: Marseille faces Montpellier in French Cup last 16Wolfsburg signs American winger Paredes from D.C.
