HOUSTON (AP) — A judge has found no probable cause to support a charge a Houston mother faces after being accused of placing her 13-year-old son in the trunk of her car in an attempt to isolate him after he tested positive for COVID-19.The 41-year-old mother had been charged by prosecutors  with endangering a child, a felony. Authorities allege her son was found Jan. 3 in her car’s trunk at a drive-thru testing site for the Cypress-Fairbanks school district at a stadium in northwest Houston.But during a court hearing Thursday, state District Judge Chris Morton ruled prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to support the charge.The judge’s decision did not mean the end of the case, however, as prosecutors will have to decide whether to dismiss the charge or continue investigating.

The woman is a teacher with the Cypress-Fairbanks school district, which said in a statement that the child was not harmed. The district has said she is on administrative leave.
