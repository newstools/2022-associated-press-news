LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan has received an initial, small federal shipment of COVID-19 pills that can be taken at home, state health officials announced Friday.The arrival of the newly authorized oral medications comes as the state confronts record high coronavirus cases and near-peak hospitalizations amid a surge fueled by the omicron variant. The pills cleared federal approvals over two weeks ago and can only be obtained with a prescription.The first allocation includes 7,080 courses of Merck’s molnupiravir and 1,600 courses of Pfizer’s Paxlovid. Paxlovid is likely to become the first-choice treatment against the virus, because of its superior benefits and milder side effects.ADVERTISEMENTPfizer’s pills initially will be distributed by 10 Meijer pharmacies in the hardest-hit areas of three regions that include the Detroit area, Thumb, the Bay region and some counties north of there.“This is a scarce medical resource,” state health department spokesperson Lynn Sutfin said.Coronavirus pandemicFamilies despair over post-holiday return to remote learningIn omicron outbreak, US governors lose appetite for mandatesHow do I know if I have a cold, the flu or COVID-19?As omicron spreads, Europe scrambles to shore up health careMerck’s pills will be distributed by Meijer and other pharmacies.The antivirals have to be taken as soon as possible once symptoms appear.
