FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The Broward Health hospital system on Saturday said it suffered a data breach in October where a hacker accessed personal and medical information of patients and staff. A statement  from the hospital said the intruder accessed names, birthdays, addresses, banking information, social security numbers, drivers’ license numbers, patient histories and treatment and diagnosis records, among other information. The information was removed from the hospital’s system, “however, there is no evidence the information was actually misused,” the statement said. The intruder gained access to its network on Oct. 15 through a third-part medical provider that was allowed to access its systems. Broward Health detected the intrusion Oct. 19 and notified the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice. The DOJ asked the hospital to not immediately make the breach public in order to preserve an ongoing law enforcement investigation, the statement said. The hospital did not specify how many people’s information was accessed during the breach. Broward Health operates more than 30 health care locations in Broward County.
