COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Georgia’s Lovasea Carroll is leaving the national champions and joining South Carolina’s football program. Carroll posted his decision Monday on social media. Carroll was moved from running back to the secondary by the Bulldogs and is expected to return to the offensive backfield with the Gamecocks. Carroll, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound freshman from Warrenton, Georgia, posted a photo of himself in a Gamecocks’ uniform with the words, “Committed, Lovasea Carroll, South Carolina,” across the bottom. Carroll played in four games in the secondary for the Bulldogs last season. He finished the season with three tackles and a pass breakup. Carroll is expected to bolster a running back spot at South Carolina after its two leading rushers this season, Kevin Harris and ZaQuandre White, declared for the NFL draft. Carroll’s pickup continues a strong use of the NCAA transfer portal by South Carolina’s Shane Beamer, who went 7-6 in his first year as coach.ADVERTISEMENTThe Gamecocks have picked up ex-Oklahoma quarterback Spencer Rattler and his Sooners’ teammate tight end Austin Stogner. South Carolina has also signed tailback Christian Bale-Smith, who was Wake Forest’s leading rusher last season. ___More AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 Sign up for the AP’s college football newsletter: https://apnews.com/cfbtop25
