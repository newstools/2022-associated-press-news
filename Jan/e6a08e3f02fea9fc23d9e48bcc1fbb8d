LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Lincoln Public Schools will again require masks in all schools when classes resume this week, district officials announced Monday. Two weeks ago, the district had planned to require masks only for elementary school students and staff during the upcoming semester. But warnings about increasing COVID-19 cases driven by the omicron variant and holiday gatherings prompted officials to change the requirements, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. Superintendent Steve Joel said some staff members who were vaccinated have contracted the variant, which could lead to staffing shortages when classes resume Wednesday. Masks will be required for everyone inside school district buildings and on buses. That includes athletic events starting Tuesday.
