CHARLESTON S.C (AP) — The College of Charleston is creating a new school to help train more health care workers in South Carolina.The college’s trustees voted unanimously Thursday to start the new School of Health Sciences in summer 2022. The school will be integrated with the college’s current Department of Health and Human Performance, both with programs and classroom space, officials said.The College of Charleston has been considering a program like this for a while, and the COVID-19 pandemic showed how badly it was needed, President Andrew Hsu said.The program will not only train health care workers that don’t need advanced degrees but also work with the Medical University of South Carolina for students that want to become doctors or need more advanced academic work.
