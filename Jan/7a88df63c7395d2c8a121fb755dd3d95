OLATHE, Kan. (AP) — Schools in Olathe and Kansas City, Kansas, have canceled classes this week as COVID-19 cases surge among staff and students in the districts. Olathe Public Schools and Kansas City, Kansas, Public Schools canceled classes for Tuesday and Wednesday, the Kansas City Star reported. There were no classes Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The closure includes before and after school care programs. Olathe Superintendent Brent Yeager said the cancellations were unavoidable as more than 800 school employees — about 20% of all Olathe schools’ staff — were out sick heading into this week. Yeager said more than 1,500 students had the virus last week. Kansas City, Kansas, Public Schools reported it had 200 teaching positions unfilled Friday.The virus-driven school staff shortage means there aren’t enough teachers to conduct online remote classes, Yeager said.The Kansas City-area school closures follow the closures of several other Kansas districts last week due to the surging virus. Those districts included Eudora, Desoto, Manhattan-Ogden, Bonner Springs and El Dorado.
