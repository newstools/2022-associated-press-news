TOKYO (AP) — Tokyo on Tuesday reported a record high of COVID-19 cases, as Japan prepared to implement new anti-virus measures amid surging infections driven by the highly contagious omicron variant.The capital city logged 12,813 new cases, while Japan’s No. 2 business district of Osaka also reported a record caseload of 8,612. Rising infections have begun to disrupt hospitals, schools and other sectors in some areas. “We must do everything not to overwhelm the medical systems, so the lives that can be saved will not be lost,” Economy Revitalization Minister Daishiro Yamagiwa, who is also in charge of COVID-19 measures, told reporters.Nationwide, more than 62,000 virus cases were reported, according to Japanese media, for an accumulated total of about 2.2 million cases and some 18,500 deaths. While indicating a new high of infections, the numbers only reflect recorded COVID-19 cases.ADVERTISEMENTA majority of the country — including Tokyo and other metropolitan areas like Osaka and Kyoto — will be placed under new restrictions from Thursday, with shortened hours for bars and restaurants and curbs on large public events.Coronavirus pandemicFDA halts use of antibody drugs that don't work vs. omicronHope seen once the omicron wave increases global immunityS.
