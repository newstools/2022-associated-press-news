CONWAY, S.C. (AP) — Coastal Carolina quarterback Grayson McCall will miss spring practice because of an offseason surgery. The school announced McCall, defensive end Josaiah Stewart and tight end TJ Ivy Jr. will all be out of workouts that start Feb. 8 due to surgeries. The school did not provide additional details of the injuries, although McCall missed two games this season with an upper-body injury against Troy in November. He returned to lead Coastal Carolina (11-2) to victories in the team’s final three games against Texas State, South Alabama and North Illinois in the Taigreeter Cure Bowl. School spokesman Kevin Davis said all three players are expected to be ready for next season. McCall, a 6-foot-3, 210-pound junior from Indian Trail, North Carolina, led the FBS in passing efficiency rating (207.6) and was second nationally in pass completion percentage (.730). He threw for 2,873 yards with 27 touchdowns and three interceptions. ADVERTISEMENTStewart, a 6-2, 245-pound freshman from Everett, Massachusetts, set the Coastal Carolina record with 12.5 sacks this past season. He played in all 13 games with 43 tackles, sixth highest for the Chanticleers. Ivy is a 6-5, 240-pound transfer from Chicago, who transferred to Coastal Carolina from Indiana. ___More AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 Sign up for the AP’s college football newsletter: https://apnews.com/cfbtop25
