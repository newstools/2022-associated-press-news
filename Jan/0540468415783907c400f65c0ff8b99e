BANGOR, Maine (AP) — St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor is moving ahead with plans to demolish eight buildings that are more than 100 years old. Four of the buildings near its main campus have already been knocked down, the Bangor Daily News reported Tuesday.St. Joseph’s president, Mary Prybylo, told the newspaper that engineering reviews found the structures had significant risks and that the safest thing was to demolish them.Seven of the properties were built in 1900 and one was built in 1910, according to city data, the newspaper reported. Bangor’s director of code enforcement, Jeff Wallace, said the city’s historic preservation rules do not apply to the buildings even though they are old.Some nearby residents hope the hospital will reconsider the demolition.
