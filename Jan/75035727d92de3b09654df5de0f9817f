Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will not require surgery, the medical team caring for him at a Sao Paulo hospital said in a statement Tuesday morning. Bolsonaro was hospitalized Monday with an intestinal obstruction, which the statement said has been resolved, without providing details. The president will begin a liquid diet, and there isn’t yet an expected date for his discharge. Bolsonaro, 66, has undergone four surgeries stemming from the abdominal stabbing he suffered during a 2018 campaign event.Related coverageBrazilian doctors rule out surgery for BolsonaroBrazil's Bolsonaro hospitalized with intestinal obstruction  Should kids be vaccinated?
