LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The Kentucky Derby Festival will return to offering live and in-person events this year, though there are some changes to the schedule.One of the most noticeable is the festival’s founding event, the Pegasus Parade, which will be held on a Sunday for the first time instead of a Thursday. It’s an effort to make it easier for people to attend, Kentucky Derby Festival President and CEO Matt Gibson said in a statement on Wednesday announcing dates for the upcoming celebration.The festival will produce dozens of events from mid-March through Derby week. Some events will have different dates than in the past, though many, including Thunder Over Louisville, will keep to tradition.“The past couple of years has given us all a new perspective and that’s been a driving force for the Festival as we’ve been planning for 2022 and beyond,” Gibson said.
