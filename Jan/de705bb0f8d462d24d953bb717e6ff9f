CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — A 50-room boutique hotel near the church where nine people were killed seven years ago in South Carolina has been sold for $27.3 million, according to property records. The Post & Courier reports that the 50-room Hotel Bella Grace in Charleston was sold by 115 Calhoun Hospitality LLC to Odyssey Propco X LLC. Odyssey Propco lists the same Fort Worth, Texas, address as TPG Capital, a global investment firm that manages $109 billion in assets and is preparing to go public in a $9.5 billion stock offering, the newspaper reported. The hotel opened in 2018. It sits across the street from Mother Emanuel AME Church, and the original owner, Donald Semmler, said the name Bella Grace was inspired by the families of the nine Black parishioners killed there in 2015. In court, family members told the killer, avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof, that they forgave him. “It’s a salute to that act of forgiveness,” Semmler had said.Roof was sentenced to death.
