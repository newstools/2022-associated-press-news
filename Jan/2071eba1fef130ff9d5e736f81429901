MILAN (AP) — It was a tale of two celebrations in Turin as Juventus beat relegation-threatened Udinese 2-0 in Serie A on Saturday.Weston McKennie sealed the match 11 minutes from time and the American – a Harry Potter fan – marked the goal with his usual wand celebration.It was a complete contrast to Paulo Dybala’s distinct lack of celebration when he scored the opener in the first half. The forward, who is embroiled in ongoing lengthy discussions over a new contract, instead gave an icy glare towards the directors’ box.“I invited a friend and I couldn’t find him,” Dybala said. He was then asked if people could believe that and responded: “I don’t know, that’s up to you ... there have been a lot of stories, a lot of things have happened, I prefer not to talk.”Juventus moved level on points with fourth-placed Atalanta, which has played two matches less than the Bianconeri. Udinese remained four points above the drop zone.Massimiliano Allegri’s side sought to bounce back from defeat to Inter Milan in the Italian Super Cup midweek.And it took the lead in the 19th minute. An Arthur through-ball found Moise Kean, who laid it off for Dybala to sweep into the back of the net.Dybala had a gilt-edged chance to double his tally in the second half when he was found by McKennie but the Argentina international fired wide of the left post.McKennie also missed a header but wasn’t going to waste a similar chance moments later as he headed a Mattia De Sciglio cross into the top right corner.IMMOBILE AT THE DOUBLECiro Immobile scored two goals and had a hand in another as Lazio won at last-placed Salernitana 3-0.Immobile scored his two within three minutes early in the match. Manuel Lazzari added a third in the second half.Lazio moved to sixth place. Salernitana remained six points from safety.Lazio was looking for its first win of 2022 and got off to the perfect start when Luis Alberto sent in a long ball, which Sergej Milinković-Savić backheeled to Immobile for the forward to place into the bottom left corner in the seventh minute.Immobile doubled their tally moments later from a cross by Pedro from close range.Immobile almost had a first half hat trick but his header bounced off the crossbar and hit the line before going out.He did have a hand in Lazio’s third as he sent a crossfield pass to Felipe Anderson, who rolled it into the path of Lazzari to fire home in the 66th.Earlier, Torino fought back to win at relegation-threatened Sampdoria 2-1.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
