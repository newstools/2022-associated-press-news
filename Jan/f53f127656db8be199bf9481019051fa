NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) — A second suspect has been arrested and a third is being sought in the death of a man authorities said was hit by a stray bullet as he was eating Thanksgiving dinner in a home in the Philadelphia suburbs.Prosecutors in Montgomery County said Monday that 19-year-old Savian Creary of Philadelphia was taken into custody Saturday and an arrest warrant was issued for 20-year-old Tymere Parker of Philadelphia. Both are charged with first- and third-degree murder and conspiracy in the Nov. 25 killing of 25-year-old Edilberto Miguel Palaez Moctezuma in Norristown. Police said the victim was shot in the torso just before 9:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and was flown to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.Nineteen-year-old Kevon Clarke of Norristown was arrested last month. Prosecutors allege that he fired several shots in the area during a dispute with relatives over liquor that had gone missing from a gathering earlier in the day. He was charged with first-degree murder, reckless endangerment and weapons offenses. ADVERTISEMENTDistrict Attorney Kevin Steele described the victim as “an innocent man who wasn’t safe even in the confines of his own home.” He said the man was “murdered while eating Thanksgiving dinner inside his home” and neither he nor his family was involved in the dispute.Court documents don’t list attorneys for Creary or Parker; a listed number for Creary couldn’t be found and a number listed for Parker wasn’t in service Monday.
