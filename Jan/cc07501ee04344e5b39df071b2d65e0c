With Mike Glennon out with a wrist injury, the second-year quarterback is likely to get his second career start in the finale.

Fromm was lifted in the third quarter after throwing an interception that led to a go-ahead score. His only other appearance came the week before when he was 6 of 12 for 82 yards against Dallas, playing the final series in garbage time. This will be a chance to show the team he can play.KEY MATCHUP: How the Giants defend Washington star receiver Terry McLaurin. He had 11 catches for 107 yards and a touchdown on Sept. 16.
