VIDALIA, La. (AP) — A northeast Louisiana parish is preparing to get a new tax assessor now that a man who has worked in the assessor’s office for 44 years is preparing to step down. Jerry Clark has been the Concordia Parish assessor for just over nine years. But he started working in the assessor’s office in June 1977. And he was chief deputy assessor for 15 years before he was elected to his current job. The Natchez Democrat reports that Clark is retiring on March 31. The Concordia Parish Police Jury appointed chief deputy assessor Jeannie Archer as the interim tax assessor until a special election is held next fall.Clark said there have been changes in the office over the years, one of the biggest being the move to online mapping in 2016.Prior to that, land records were kept on a 3-by-3-foot physical map with legal descriptions that had to be redone every year as property changed hands. Today, the changes are made digitally.
