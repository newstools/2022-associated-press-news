JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — State parks in Missouri are proving to be more popular than ever, with record numbers of visitors.The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that 22.5 million people visited Missouri state parks in 2021, a nearly 7% increase from 2020 and an all-time high for the state’s 92 parks and historic sites.The state also reported a 24% increase in campsite rentals and a 17% increase in lodging units rented.Division of State Parks Director David Kelly says the biggest complaint the division gets is that the parks are so popular people can’t always get into them.The popularity is driving the state to plan new parks, build new cabins and take other steps such as increase internet connectivity and upgrade existing campsites. Much of that work will be funded with money from the American Rescue Plan Act.
