SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Mubadala Investment Company has signed on as the title sponsor of the final regatta of SailGP’s second season, which will include the $1 million, winner-take-all podium race.The Mubadala United States Sail Grand Prix is scheduled for March 26-27 on San Francisco Bay. Defending champion Team Australia, skippered by Tom Slingsby, and Team USA, skippered by Jimmy Spithill, have already qualified for the podium race. The third team will be determined during the fleet racing portion of the San Francisco regatta. Mubadala, based in Abu Dhabi, also will be the presenting partner of SailGP Inspire Learning, which will help introduce more than 1,000 young people to various aspects of sailing in the month before the regatta, which will be contested in foiling 50-foot catamarans. Spithill, who helmed Oracle Team USA to a thrilling America’s Cup victory on San Francisco Bay in 2013, is excited about the chance to compete for the grand prize.ADVERTISEMENT“I’d sum up our season as a wild ride. It has had everything: crashes, capsizes, broken bones, collisions, you name it we’ve been there,” he said. “What’s important is that we are in the finale. We started off the season last place, but through fighting our way back as a new team in the USA roster, we have crawled our way up and have a shot at the $1 million.“Once you put your mind to it, it is amazing the impact you can have. It’s been an amazing educational experience for all of us involved.”
