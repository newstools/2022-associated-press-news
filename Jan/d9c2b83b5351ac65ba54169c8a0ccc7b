Zakariya Abdullahi suffered a serious head injury, the coach said.A GoFundMe was created Friday morning, and by Sunday morning had raised more than $113,000 to assist in getting him back to the United State and providing medical care.ADVERTISEMENTThe GoFundMe post said it will cost $100,000 just to transport Zakariya Abdullahi to the United States “under critical condition in an Air Ambulance to keep him stable throughout his trip.”The 2015 soccer team featured players from Somalia, Kenya and Congo, elevating an already-good team to the state championship. Abdullahi was living in Minnesota with his mother before the pilgrimage, but still keeps in touch with his former teammates in Maine, said Dan Gish, coach of Lewiston High’s boys soccer team.
