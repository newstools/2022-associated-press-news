TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — Federal prosecutors are trying to reinstate charges against a former Michigan lawmaker from the Traverse City area who was accused of trading votes for campaign money when he served in the House.A three-judge panel at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Thursday, the Traverse City Record-Eagle reported.In 2019, Larry Inman was acquitted of lying to the FBI, but the jury couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict on other charges.A judge last year said Inman’s constitutional rights would be violated if he faced a second trial on charges of soliciting a bribe and attempted extortion.ADVERTISEMENTJurors didn’t believe Inman was lying about his acts, a “key predicate” underlining the other charges, U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker said.In text messages, Inman, a Republican, urged labor advocates to round up campaign contributions from other unions to win the votes of lawmakers who were under pressure in 2018 to repeal a wage law. He denied wrongdoing.
