Neither missed a 3-pointer in the first 6 1/2 minutes, with Arizona making its first four and UCLA hitting its first three.But the Wildcats missed their next 11 3-point attempts and their shooting slumped to 35% in the half. The Bruins ran off 12 points in a row to erase a four-point deficit. They shot 53% in the half and led by 15 before settling for a 40-29 advantage at the break.The arena was fully reopened to fans after being closed to all but families and friends of the players and coaching staff since Jan. 6 because of surging COVID-19 cases. BIG PICTUREArizona: The Wildcats had been off to their best start since going 21-0 in 2013-14. They had dominated their previous three league road games, winning by at least 25 points. But their 31% shooting didn’t help, along with 14 turnovers. They lost their sixth in a row to UCLA and will need a short memory because the Bruins visit Tucson next week.UCLA: The Bruins improved to 8-1 at home, buoyed by the electric atmosphere that recalled games between the rivals from years past. They won without Jaylen Clark, who is averaging 18 minutes, after he got hit in the face at practice Monday and was experiencing concussion-like symptoms. UP NEXTArizona: Hosts Arizona State on Saturday to open a three-game homestand. UCLA: Hosts California on Thursday in the second of three straight home games. The Bruins won the first matchup by eight points on Jan. 8.___More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
