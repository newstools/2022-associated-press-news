LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Gretna High School was stripped of its 2021 Class A state football championship on Thursday following a vote of the Nebraska School Activities Association board.The board voted 8-0 to uphold executive director Jay Bellar’s ruling that the Dragons used an ineligible player last season. Gretna beat Omaha Westside 7-3 in the November title game at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln.The school must return the championship trophy, but the players will be allowed to keep their medals. There will be no Class A champion listed for 2021.The ineligible player was junior Tyson Boganowski. He attended Papillion-La Vista South High his freshman and sophomore years. The board agreed with Bellard that there was not adequate documentation to show Boganowski had a change of residence when he transferred to Gretna High, which is about eight miles west of his previous school and in a different school district.ADVERTISEMENTBoganowski appeared in all 13 Gretna games last fall and caught six passes for 47 yards in the state title game.The Dragons moved into Nebraska’s big-school sports class for football in 2018 after having played in Class B, where it made regular appearances in the playoffs but never won a title.Gretna principal Todd Mueller and athletic director Matthew Curtis did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
