WAKEFIELD, N.H. (AP) — A railroad station and freight shed in Wakefield have been named to the National Register of Historic Places, the New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources said. The Union Railroad Station was built in 1911. The division describes it as “a single story wood-frame building that incorporates characteristics of several late Victorian architectural styles” with a three-sided bay window for viewing arriving and departing trains.The station’s interior was converted to a single-family residence and television repair shop after the Boston & Maine Railroad decommissioned the building in 1956. The Wakefield Heritage Commission purchased the property in 2006 as part of its effort to create the Wakefield Heritage Park Museum. It returned the layout to close to the original construction. The division said the station’s original vertical beadboard walls and ceilings in the waiting room, still covered in varnish or shellac, were discovered underneath gypsum board that had been installed when the building was a residence. ADVERTISEMENTThe single-story freight shed, built circa 1875, has large, elevated cargo bays to allow for the easy transfer of goods.In New Hampshire, listing to the National Register makes property owners eligible for grants such as the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program and the Conservation License Plate Program.
