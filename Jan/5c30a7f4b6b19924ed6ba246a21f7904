FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear set a blistering fundraising pace since launching his 2023 reelection bid, raising $1.3 million in the final three months of last year, his campaign said Monday.The Democratic governor’s campaign called it the strongest initial fundraising figure posted by an incumbent governor in the Bluegrass State. Beshear is stockpiling campaign cash in preparation for a tough campaign in a state dominated by Republicans eager to win back the governorship.Beshear said he’s grateful for the support, which he said came from all over Kentucky and across party lines.“The support we’re seeing from folks everywhere shows that investing in health care and education, creating good-paying jobs in every community and leading with our shared Kentucky values —honesty, decency and transparency — matters to our people,” he said. Beshear has been in crisis management for most of his term. The COVID-19 pandemic hit about three months after he took office. Last month, tornadoes devastated parts of western Kentucky, putting the governor front and center as he led the state’s response and hosted a visit from President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat.Coronavirus pandemicPentagon chief Austin says he has tested positive for COVIDPrime Minister Morrison upbeat amid Australia virus surgeLive updates: Ontario closes schools, indoor dining and gymsOntario shuts schools, indoor dining and gymsADVERTISEMENTThe governor has feuded with the GOP-dominated legislature over pandemic, education and budget policies.
