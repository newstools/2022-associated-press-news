TIRANA, Albania (AP) — An explosion shook the home of Albanian soccer federation president Armand Duka without causing injuries, his spokesman said Tuesday.The incident prompted European soccer’s ruling body UEFA to voice security concerns about the capital Tirana hosting the final of the inaugural Europa Conference League on May 25. UEFA said its officials will travel to Albania soon to discuss ongoing concerns about political interference in soccer there ahead of federation elections. If Duka was to lose the presidential vote on March 2, he would have to give up his seat on UEFA’s executive committee at elections due next year.The Albanian contest has sparked a clash between Duka and the Tirana city hall, which has accused him of corruption.UEFA said its delegation wants to “discuss the current issues and raise its concerns regarding the safe staging of the 2022 UEFA Europa Conference League in Tirana in light of the recent events.”The explosion occurred Monday at Duka’s home in the western port city of Durres, his spokesman Andi Vercani said. Duka’s wife and son were at home but were not injured. He was in Tirana.Cameras captured an image of a hooded person apparently setting the explosive.On Tuesday, Duka said he had received a life-threatening text message asking him to resign.The 59-year-old Duka has led Albania’s soccer federation since 2002 and is running for re-election as the main candidate. UEFA described outside interference in Albanian soccer as “clearly inadmissible” and a breach of its legal rules.The Albanian federation’s website was also hacked and is not running.UEFA picked Albania to host the Europa Conference League final at the 22,000-seat national stadium which opened in 2019.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
