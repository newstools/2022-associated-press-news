(AP) — Newport News Shipbuilding — Virginia’s largest industrial employer and a key player in the Navy’s modernization efforts -- has reached a tentative five-year contract with its biggest union.

Both agreements called for annual pay increases.

Kirk said the union planned briefing the 12,000 workers in its collective bargaining union before they’re asked to vote on it. Kirk also said the the agreement includes pension improvements, a cap on health care costs union members pay and the first benefit domestic partners.ADVERTISEMENTNewport News Shipbuilding spokesman Danny Hernandez confirmed the tentative agreement was reached Friday.
