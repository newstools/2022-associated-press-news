TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) — Two workers were injured when part of a building collapsed at the Alabama School for the Deaf, raining down bricks and other material, authorities said. The failure happened Wednesday morning at the student center of the school, which is part of the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind, according to a statement from Talladega Fire and Rescue released on social media. The weight of a lift collapsed the floor below an area where people were working on the building, the statement said. The two who were injured weren’t trapped and were taken for treatment by ambulance, but further information about their condition wasn’t immediately available.The school said no students were in the area at the time of the accident, and school workers including a nurse and security staff assisted afterward. “The building structure is being evaluated to determine if there are ongoing safety issues. The building is currently secured and all affected areas have been blocked to protect the safety of students and staff,” said a statement from school spokesperson John Mascia.Located in Talladega, the institute has six campuses that educate, rehabilitate and serve deaf and blind people.
