TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Gov. Laura Kelly called Tuesday for another freeze in tuition at Kansas colleges in a State of the State address that portrayed the state as booming economically and previewed what are likely to be major themes in her reelection campaign.The Democratic governor didn’t provide details about her college tuition proposal in the annual address, saying only that it is part of the proposed state budget that her administration will outline Wednesday. Kelly already is pushing to eliminate the state’s sales tax on groceries and give a $250 rebate to every Kansas resident who filed a state income tax return last year.Her proposals on taxes and college tuition come ahead of a tough reelection race with three-term state Attorney General Derek Schmidt as the presumed Republican nominee. Kelly will need support from moderate GOP and independent voters to win another four-year term in her Republican-leaning state, and she’s been making moves to appeal to them that include opposing federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates from Democratic President Joe Biden.Coronavirus pandemicChina locks down 3rd city, raising affected to 20 millionPoland hits sad milestone of 100,000 deaths from COVID-19Japan keeps border controls as it prepares for omicron surgeIndiana governor says COVID-19 remains state challengeADVERTISEMENTKelly suggested that the state’s improved finances and the coronavirus pandemic warranted a tuition freeze at state colleges. “You heard that right: No tuition increases whatsoever,” she said in the version of her speech prepared for delivery. “The virus took something from our students. And, we are going to give them something back.”The governor’s tuition proposal follows years of concerns about rising college costs — and efforts by both legislators and the state Board of Regents to contain them. The board, which oversees the state’s higher education system, last year froze fall tuition at the state’s six universities, except for Kansas State University. At some universities, tuition has been frozen three years. Yet costs for students and their families are much higher than they were 15 years ago and now approach $5,600 a semester in tuition and academic fees at the University of Kansas for a full-time Kansas undergraduate — almost 82% more. At Kansas State, the same costs for a similar student have grown 80% and now top $5,200 a semester.ADVERTISEMENTIn the GOP’s official response to Kelly’s address, recorded before she made her tuition proposal public, state House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., an Olathe Republican, said, “It’s not enough to talk about goals.”“Many Kansans say they have grown tired of broken promises,” Ryckman added in remarks prepared for delivery.Much of Kelly’s address to a joint session of the GOP-controlled Legislature focused on the state’s financial recovery despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic — and after persistent budget shortfalls that followed a nationally notorious GOP-led experiment in cutting income taxes starting in 2012. Kansas has seen its monthly tax collections exceed expectations in all but three months in the 4 1/2 years since bipartisan legislative majorities repealed most of the previous tax-cutting experiment championed by GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. With no tax cuts or huge surge in state spending, it’s on pace to end June 2023 with roughly $3.9 billion in cash reserves.“The people of Kansas are getting back on their feet,” Kelly declared. “The state of Kansas is getting back on track.”Schmidt and other Republicans argue that the good times are being fueled mostly by the billions of dollars in pandemic relief funds sent to the states by the federal government. Schmidt on Sunday proposed dedicating $1 billion to shoring up the state pension system for teachers and government workers — echoing comments from top Republican lawmakers.Republicans have suggested that Kelly’s tributes to business growth ring hollow when she shut many businesses down for five weeks last year — an action she took to check the spread of COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Republicans also have questioned Kelly’s commitment to cutting taxes because she vetoed three GOP proposals in three years after suggesting the measures would tank the state’ finances. Schmidt also has called for cutting or eliminating the state’s 6.5% sales tax on groceries. With bipartisan support, Kelly said, the only obstacle to passing the proposal is “the same type of toxic political games that have poisoned Washington, D.C.”“We are better than that in Kansas,” she said. “Let’s not overcomplicate this.”However, Ryckman said Republicans want to “ratchet down” the sales tax, not only on groceries but “on everything else our families need to buy.”___Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna
