FAIRFIELD, Ala. (AP) — A Pennsylvania company said it plans to reopen a piece of Birmingham’s manufacturing industry by spending $25 million on an old plant that will become a production, service and distribution center. HarbisonWalker International said Friday that construction will begin early this year at a site west of downtown in Fairfield, and the 200,000-square foot facility is expected to open by the end of the year. About 50 people will work at the plant, it said.The company makes refractory products, which are designed to withstand extremely high temperatures in uses including steel production. It shut down the same site in 2019 when it decided to end a business line, carbon bake brick products.Chief executive Carol Jackson said the company decided to return to the site after considering several other places.“The location is ideal for delivering quality refractory products and high-value services to our customers’ growing steel operations in the southern U.S.,” said Jackson.Based in Pittsburgh, the company has 18 manufacturing plants and other facilities in the United States and China.
