TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) — Indiana State University’s spring enrollment has fallen nearly 25% since 2019, a drop school officials blame in part on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.ISU’s spring enrollment fell this year to 8,541, which is down 11.6% from spring 2021, and continues a recent trend. In spring 2020, spring enrollment on the Terre Haute campus was 10,584, while in spring 2019, it was 11,382.The numbers mean ISU has experienced an almost 25% spring enrollment drop since 2019, although the numbers do not include dual credit high school students, the Tribune-Star reported.The school’s fall enrollment has dropped between 2018 and 2021 by 3,017 students, or 24%. Those numbers also do not include dual credit high school students.ADVERTISEMENTThe university has attributed enrollment declines in recent years to the continuing impact of the pandemic. ISU draws many first-generation and Pell-eligible students, and nationally many of them are more likely to delay going to college.Another factor is that there are fewer 18-year-olds graduating from high school, especially in the Midwest.
