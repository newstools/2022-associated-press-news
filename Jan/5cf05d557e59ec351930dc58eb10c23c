NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City subway rider was hospitalized with a leg injury after being pushed onto the tracks Sunday, the latest episode amid heightened concerns about crime in the nation’s largest transit system. The 62-year-old man made contact with a train and fell onto the tracks, police said. He suffered a leg laceration and was taken to a hospital for treatment. It was not immediately clear how seriously he was injured.A victim was pushed from behind at the Fulton Street station in lower Manhattan while standing on the southbound platform on the A/C line as a C train was approaching at around 11:30 a.m., according to police. The attack came as public officials seek to quell an increase in subway crime. Eight days ago, a woman was pushed to her death at the Times Square station. A 61-year-old man has been charged with her murder.
