FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky broke records for investment and job creation in 2021, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday.Last year, 264 private-sector projects committed to invest over $11.2 billion and create over 18,100 full-time jobs. This includes a decision by Ford Motor Co. and its battery partner to build twin battery plants in Glendale, Kentucky. Beshear called it the “single largest economic development project in the state’s history” and said it will create 5,000 jobs. Wages have risen as well. Kentucky’s average incentivized hourly wage for projects statewide in 2021 was $24 before benefits, a 9.4% increase over 2020 and the second highest mark of the past seven years.
