TORONTO (AP) — The Toronto Blue Jays traded outfielder Randal Grichuk and just over $9.7 million to the Colorado Rockies on Thursday for outfielder Raimel Tapia and minor league infielder Adrian Pinto. The 29-year-old Grichuk hit .241 with 22 homers and 81 RBIs in 149 games last season. He was dealt two days after hitting a grand slam in a spring training game against the Yankees.The cash will offset a little more than half the $18.7 million Grichuk is owed over the final two seasons of his $52 million, five-year contract.Toronto will pay Colorado $9,716,333 — $5,383,333 this year and $4,333,333 in 2023 — covering a little more than half the $18,666,666 owed to Grichuk, who has salaries of $9,333,333 in each of the next two seasons.Tapia agreed this week to a $3.95 million, one-year contract and is eligible for free agency after the 2023 season.The free agent signing of infielder/outfielder Kris Bryant had a big impact on Tapia, who was penciled in as the team’s left fielder before Bryant’s arrival. Tapia became the odd-outfielder-out with Sam Hilliard in center and Charlie Blackmon in right.ADVERTISEMENTMLBAll-Star reliever, MLB union rep Andrew Miller retires at 36NYC lifts vaccine rule that blocked athletes from home gamesTwo weeks from opening day, MLB teams work to set rostersYanks' Torres, Angels' Adell off to good spring startsKnown for his speed, Tapia tied for the team lead with 20 stolen bases last season.
