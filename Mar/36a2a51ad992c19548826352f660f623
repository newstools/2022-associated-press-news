COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) — Tyrece Radford recorded 14 points and 14 rebounds to lift Texas A&M, still stung by missing the NCAA Tournament, to a 74-62 win over Alcorn State in the NIT first round on Tuesday night.Wade Taylor IV and Hassan Diarra each had 12 points for Texas A&M (24-12). Quenton Jackson had 10 points.Coach Buzz Williams began his postgame press conference with a statement lasting nearly eight minutes  in which he questioned why the NCAA Tournament selection committee didn’t invite the Aggies, who had a strong finish before losing to Tennessee in the SEC championship game.Williams said he was given no specific data, only generalities, and said there must be no bias in the process. He said Texas A&M’s exclusion “defies logic.”“The process is obviously flawed and it is apparent that there is way more included that is unseen and unknown in the selection of the 36 at-large teams than what the public is made aware of,” Williams said. “Until there is complete transparency and accountability, the system will stay broken and this will continue to happen.” SportsScoring spree: 50-point games are the rage in NBA right nowOvechkin now 3rd on NHL goals list, Caps beat Isles in SOIrving scores career-best 60 points, Nets rout Magic 150-108NCAA Tournament features dynamic guards, backcourt wizardsADVERTISEMENTDominic Brewton scored a season-high 20 points for the Braves (17-17).
