During the hearing Monday, Price’s attorney listed other books in the Gary Road Elementary library that have similar themes or illustrations, including “Captain Underpants.”Price said he is strengthened by support from the public, including letters from parents and grandparents that show children reading the book.The hearing is scheduled to resume next week.
