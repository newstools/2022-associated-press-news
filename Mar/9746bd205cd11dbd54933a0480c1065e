WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Washington manager Dave Martinez actively lobbied for the Nationals to play more night games this spring.He got his wish. Of the five teams within the Nationals’ spring training scheduling pod only Saturday’s opponent, the New York Mets, will play more Grapefruit League night games this year than Washington’s six.“I think it gives players a different perspective as far as getting ready because we do play night games and then turn around and play a day game,” Martinez said. “Even though it will be a different lineup, they can get their bodies accustomed to getting up after a night game and getting prepared, and getting ready.”Martinez isn’t alone in his desire for later spring start times.“I’d do them all that way,” Mets manager Buck Showalter said.Playing at night serves some practical purposes for Martinez during this condensed spring training due to the labor lockout. ADVERTISEMENTIt allowed him to watch Patrick Corbin, the probable Nationals opening day starter, throw his second live batting practice of the spring in the morning. Corbin threw 42 pitches during three simulated innings, likely the left-hander’s final tune-up before making his first Grapefruit League start.MLBNats skipper Martinez lobbied for night games this springAP source: Marlins, Soler agree on $36 million, 3-year dealRangers sign 3-time All-Star INF Carpenter to minor dealCloser by committee?

Your body needs to adjust. For some guys that’s more of an issue than others.”ADVERTISEMENTAnd there’s at least one more benefit to night games in Florida.When New York’s Luis Guillorme smacked the second pitch of the game from Josiah Gray over the left-field wall, he did so seconds after the announcement of the game-time temperature being 84 degrees. “It’s going to start getting hot here so having those night games, it’s kind of nice,” Martinez said.NOTES: Nationals third baseman Carter Kieboom underwent an MRI on his right elbow after experiencing pain that caused him to be scratched from Friday’s lineup.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
