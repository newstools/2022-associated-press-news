DICKINSON, N.D. (AP) — A Dickinson woman attributes her longevity to a healthy lifestyle and keeping busy. Helma Lein celebrated birthday number 106 with family and friends at her retirement home this week. “I will go to craft class and make crafts. I’ve made bird houses,” said Lein, who also likes to write. “Leaves of yellow, orange, and red cover grasses like a bed,” said Lein.Lein was born on a farm in Grant County in 1916. She says her mother died from the flu at a young age, but despite losing her, Lein graduated from school.“I was lucky and when I graduated from this college, I was told that the Bismarck Tribune needed three secretaries,” Lein told KFYR-TV.After working for the Tribune, Lein moved to San Diego and worked for the Navy after her husband Ray was called to service in World War II. When Ray returned from overseas, they moved to Wing, North Dakota and raised their three children. ADVERTISEMENTLein’s advice to the younger generation is to cherish time with family and maintain your faith.“Raise your children in the church and I think music is important,” she said as she looks forward to another trip around the sun. “Happy 106 birthday, let’s start planning 107,” Lein said.
