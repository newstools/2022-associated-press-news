PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Gov, Doug Ducey is OK with Arizona dentists being able to offer Botox injections to smooth out facial wrinkles as they also handle their patients’ tooth-decay issues.The Republican governor signed off on a bill the Legislature overwhelmingly approved allowing dentists to give cosmetic injections of Botox or so-called dermal fillers. It will take effect this summer, 90 days after the Legislature adjourns for the year.Dentists already are allowed to use Botox, which temporarily relaxes muscles and has a wrinkle-reducing effect, for medical reasons. They include treatment of TMJ, a painful jaw disorder. ADVERTISEMENTBut they have not been allowed to use the medication for esthetic reasons. Dentists testified that they already are highly trained in medication injections in the head and neck area. And some are certified to use Botox for cosmetic purposes.
