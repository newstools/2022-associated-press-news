PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — The Portland City Council has voted to ban the sale and use of fireworks in the city.The unanimous vote Wednesday comes after a temporary ban in 2021 around the Fourth of July, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Officials cited rising temperatures, drought and increased fire risk, all because of climate change, in voting for the year-round ban. Fireworks caused 44 fires in the city in 2020 between June 23 and July 6. Portland had 15 fires caused by fireworks during a similar time period in 2021 when the devices were temporarily banned. One of the Fourth of July fires, at the Heidi Manor apartments, ignited after someone threw fireworks in a dumpster. Three people died.ADVERTISEMENT“I take the danger caused by fireworks to our community as well as our brave firefighters at (Portland Fire & Rescue) very seriously,” Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty tweeted. “We must adapt during a climate emergency.”Fireworks also take a toll on pets and their owners, officials said.
