The Rev. Gregory Boyle will receive an honorary degree in recognition of his work with former gang leaders. The Loyola law school’s speaker will be retired Judge Calvin Johnson, the first Black person elected to serve on the state bench in Orleans Parish.Payton left the Saints after compiling a 152-89 regular-season record — and nine playoff appearances — in 15 seasons. He coached the club to its only Super Bowl championship.
