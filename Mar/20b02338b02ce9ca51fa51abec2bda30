BRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) — Maine’s independent senator is introducing a proposal to cap out-of-pocket insulin costs.Sen. Angus King said the bill would build on a Maine law that caps the costs for people with state-regulated commercial insurance. He said his proposal would require Medicare and private plans to ensure no patients have out-of-pocket insulin costs that exceed $35 per month.King said the proposal would save many families thousands of dollars per year. In Maine, more than 100,000 people have diabetes, and the state is one of only a few that cap insulin costs, he said.King cited an estimate that diabetics spend close to $6,000 annually on insulin. He said no one “should ever have to choose between paying for life-sustaining medication or putting food on the table.”
