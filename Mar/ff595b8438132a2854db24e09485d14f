MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Raheem Mostert agreed to a one-year deal Wednesday with the Miami Dolphins, who continued to add depth to their running back corps.Mostert had just two carries with San Francisco this past season, leaving the 49ers’ opener with chipped cartilage in a knee and missing the remainder of the season. Mostert played only eight games in 2020 because of ankle and knee injuries.But he and new Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel have familiarity, given that McDaniel was the offensive coordinator in San Francisco this past season.“Happy to announce that my client Raheem Mostert has agreed to a new deal with the Miami Dolphins,” Mostert’s agent, Brett Tessler, tweeted. “Had multiple teams interested but wanted to continue working with Mike McDaniel.”Mostert’s career started with the Dolphins in 2015. He had two kickoff returns in a game against Jacksonville that season, didn’t play again, got waived and wound up with Baltimore and Cleveland later that year.He started the 2016 season with Chicago, ended the year with San Francisco and had been with the 49ers ever since. He has 284 career carries for 1,610 yards and 11 touchdowns.___More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
