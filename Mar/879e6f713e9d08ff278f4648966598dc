BERLIN (AP) — Erling Haaland and Gio Reyna returned from injury Sunday as Borussia Dortmund cut Bayern Munich’s Bundesliga lead to seven points with a 1-0 win over coronavirus-hit Arminia Bielefeld.Marius Wolf’s first-half goal was enough for Dortmund to re-inject a measure of excitement into the title race with eight rounds left. Dortmund still has a game in hand on Bayern and can further reduce the nine-time defending champions’ lead to four points on Wednesday with a win at Mainz in their postponed match.With Haaland and Reyna back in action, Dortmund fans will feel anything is possible. Dortmund coach Marco Rose sent on the two stars in the 62nd minute for Donny Malen and Thorgan Hazard.Reyna shot just wide in the 82nd after combining well with Haaland but neither was able to mark the occasion with a goal.The 21-year-old Haaland was back after seven weeks out with a groin injury, while American forward Reyna returned three weeks after leaving the field in tears amid concerns he had suffered a recurrence of the hamstring injury that forced him to miss most of the season. Those fears were unfounded as the injury proved less serious.SportsTom Brady is returning to Tampa to play 23rd season in NFLBack to normal: Zags, Baylor join KU, Arizona as NCAA No. 1sNow that NCAA brackets are out, here's what you should knowSouth Carolina top overall seed in women's NCAA TournamentADVERTISEMENTDortmund had other injury concerns with Mats Hummels, Raphäel Guerreiro and Marco Reus among those out, while Bielefeld was without six players and coach Frank Kramer due to coronavirus infections.
