Other clubs might want a permanent solution, and Cruz certainly fills that role.Cruz made one start in the field last year — playing first base for the first time in his career, he made a nifty pickup on a bounced throw to end the first inning at Philadelphia. He delivered a tiebreaking, two-run double in the eighth to win that game.Prior to that, his previous time with a mitt was 2018 when he made four starts in right field for Seattle.___AP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
