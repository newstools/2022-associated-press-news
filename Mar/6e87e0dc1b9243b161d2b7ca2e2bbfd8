MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian police officer in Mariupol has warned that  the besieged port city has been “wiped off the face of the earth” and pleaded with the presidents of the United States and France to provide his country with a modern air defense system.In a video post from a rubble-strewn street, Mariupol police officer Michail Vershnin told President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron that they had promised assistance “but what we have received is not quite it,” and urged them to save the civilian population.“Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it has been wiped off the face of the earth,” he said speaking in Russian in the video filmed Friday that was authenticated by The Associated Press.

Apparent explosions could also be heard.Russia-Ukraine warRussia-Ukraine war: Key things to know about the conflictMariupol police officer pleads for help from Biden, MacronPriceless paper: Refugees get IDs for new lives in Poland  Ukraine's cultural capital no longer distant from the war“You have promised that there will be help, give us that help. Biden, Macron, you are great leaders. Be them to the end,” he said. Vershnin said the city is facing the fate of the Syrian city of  Aleppo that was destroyed in 2016 in a Russian-backed siege during Syria’s revolution-turned-civil war. Russia helped Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government with a ruthless strategy by locking sieges around opposition-held areas, bombarding and starving them until the population’s ability to hold out collapsed.Years ago, Mariupol also endured fierce fighting against Russia-backed separatists after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but managed to beat back repeated assaults.___Follow all AP stories on the Russian war against Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.
