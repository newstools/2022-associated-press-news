But the Chiefs monopolized possession for the remainder of the match and gradually wore down the resolute defense of the Crusaders to achieve their first win in Christchurch in six years.Winger Shaun Stevenson scored his second try of the match in the 76th minute to bring the Chiefs within range of the Crusaders at 22-17. They relentlessly battered the Crusaders’ goal line for the remainder of the match and the defense finally yielded for Pohipi to score the winning try.Flyhalf Bryn Gatland converted from the sideline.The Chiefs had narrowly failed to pull off a last-minute win over the Auckland-based Blues in their previous match when Gatland’s attempted penalty after full time, which could have been a match-winner, drifted wide of the posts.ADVERTISEMENT“We were on the other end of a result like that last weekend,” Chiefs captain Sam Cane said. “Every time the Kiwi teams play it’s down to the wire.SportsSpurs' Gregg Popovich becomes NBA regular-season wins leaderJames scores 50, rallies Lakers past Wizards for 122-109 winBUBBLE WATCH: Virginia Tech 1 win from automatic bidMLB spring camps open, Bieber in Guardians gear, Vlad Jr set“We had a mountain of possession in that second half and they defended so well. We just had to keep plugging, building phases and we stayed disciplined and managed to get what we needed just in the nick of time.The loss was the first of the season for the 12-time champion Crusaders and their first in 11 matches over two seasons.The Crusaders led 14-10 at halftime and went ahead 21-10 after a multi-phase attack which led to Ennor’s try.The match slowly turned in the Chief’s favor throughout the second half as they won a larger share of possession and tested the tough Crusaders’ defense with phased attacks.The Chiefs created an overlap for Stevenson’s second try and again overwhelmed the defense with numbers to set up the match-winner.“I think they wanted to play a bit more and hold onto the ball in the second half,” Crusaders captain Codie Taylor said. “We probably didn’t nail our defensive roles and when you do that and they get a roll on, they’ve got some classy players and they put pressure on us.”In a later match, the Queensland Reds avoided an upset to beat competition newcomers the Fijian Drua 33-28.The Reds led 28-9 with 18 minutes to play after scoring their fourth unanswered try before three runaway five-pointers against a tiring Reds defense turned the game,Five-eighth Teti Tela had a chance to put the Drua ahead of the reigning domestic champions with 10 minutes to play, but hit the post with his conversion attempt.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
