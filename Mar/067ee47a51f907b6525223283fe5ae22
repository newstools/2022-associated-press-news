Hy-Vee, the Iowa-headquartered grocery chain sponsoring the weekend, has vowed to turn the sporting event into a larger entertainment experience.“We want this event to be one of the most talked about events of the year,” said Randy Edeker, Hy-Vee’s chairman and CEO. “Iowa will be the place to be this summer with these live music acts, coupled with nationally televised IndyCar races and a festival-like atmosphere that has something for everyone to enjoy.”McGraw is scheduled to play before the July 23 race, with Florida Georgia Line scheduled after the event. Stefani will perform before the July 24 race and Shelton, her husband, has the postrace show.ADVERTISEMENTThe artists are scheduled to perform for 50 minutes before the race, with a 90-minute show planned postrace.
