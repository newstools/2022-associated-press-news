WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Moana Pasifika made its long-awaited debut in Super Rugby on Friday, losing 33-12 to the Christchurch-based Crusaders, whose margin was swelled by a last-minute try.But the team which brings together players from several Pacific Island nations, playing under one banner for the first time in Super Rugby, made a major impression on what captain Sekope Kepu described as a “historic day.”The other new team in the competition, the Fjian Drua, later won their first match, beating the Melbourne Rebels 31-26. It was the third loss in a row for the Rebels to start the season.Moana Pasifika had to wait two weeks longer than expected to play its first Super Rugby match. An outbreak of COVID-19 in the squad forced the postponement of its opening-round match against the Auckland-based Blues and its second-round match against the Chiefs also was put back because of the disruption of the squad’s enforced isolation.ADVERTISEMENTThat left the team to make its first appearance against the 12-time champions. Fielding 11 players making their Super Rugby debut and with a troubled preparation, the tournament newcomers were expected to lose easily.SportsMLB, union meet for 1 1/2 hours, discuss next step in talksClippers surge to 132-111 victory, season sweep of LakersDurant has 31 points in return, but Heat rally to beat NetsDoncic scores 41 points, Mavs beat Warriors again, 122-113Instead, Moana Pasifika scored the first try of the match through backrower Solomone Funaki in the 15th minute and were only trailing 14-5 at halftime, though they had played most of the first half with little possession and inside their own half.The Crusaders extended their lead to 21-5 early in the second half but the Pasifika squad showed itself again when they rallied with a try from replacement Fine Inisi in the 68th.The Crusaders hit back immediately with a try from Abraham Pole and finished the match with a second try from a rolling maul to hooker Codie Taylor.“It was a special one and I’d like to thank the whanau (family) for this opportunity on this historic day,” said Kepu, who played 110 tests for Australia before becoming the anchor of the Moana Pasifika scrum.At Sunshine Coast Stadium north of Brisbane, the Drua trailed 14-0 and were a man down before its comeback win over the Rebels.Ray Nu’u scored Melbourne’s fourth try on the buzzer, but four second-half penalties to replacement five-eighth Teti Tela gave the Drua the victory. Young Tonumaipea had two tries for the Rebels.Onisi Ratave scored his side’s first try after Caleb Munz’s chip kick from broken play, before Vilive Miramira streaked away for a match-turning try.The win came with a majority of the Drua squad playing in only their third Super Rugby game and after two lopsided losses to the New South Wales Waratahs and ACT Brumbies.And they had to go the long way to even get to their relocated home game on the Sunshine Coast after floods forced them out of Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.The Rebels were missing several key players but Melbourne captain Michael Wells made no excuses.“To say it’s unlucky would be disrespectful to the Drua; they played a better game than us in almost every facet,” Wells said. “We allowed them to dictate how the game was played ... we lost contact, they ran through our tackles. It was men playing boys at times.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
