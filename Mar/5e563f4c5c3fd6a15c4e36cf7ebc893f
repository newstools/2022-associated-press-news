MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Calm has prevailed on South Beach for spring break after officials imposed a strict curfew following an earlier weekend of violence and chaos.News outlets reported that Saturday night in the Miami Beach entertainment district was comparatively quiet amid the curfew from midnight to 6 a.m.The curfew was imposed in an emergency order after two shootings left five people wounded and other forms of mayhem took place last weekend.Although crowds were thinner than usual, Miami Beach Commissioner Alex Fernandez said he couldn’t risk a repeat of the same problems.“Is it less of a crowd than I would have liked to see? Yes,” he said. “I think the city is fairest to its tourists when it provides them a safe city.”Normally many of the businesses and clubs on South Beach can stay open until 4 a.m. The curfew has cut into some people’s bottom lines.ADVERTISEMENTFred Johnson, who takes people on a modified golf cart around the area, said his busiest time before the curfew didn’t even start until midnight with another peak at 4 a.m.“That’s when people are coming out of the clubs,” he said. A judge on Friday rejected attempts by businesses to end the curfew, saying the city had a “compelling interest” in promoting a safe environment.The curfew runs through Monday.
