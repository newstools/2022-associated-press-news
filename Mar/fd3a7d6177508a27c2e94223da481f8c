MEXICO CITY (AP) — New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art announced Monday that a Mexican architect has been chosen as the first woman to design a wing at The Met, as the museum is known. The Met said in a statement Monday that Mexican architect Frida Escobedo has been selected to design the renovation of The Met’s modern and contemporary galleries, known as the Oscar L. Tang and H.M. Agnes Hsu-Tang Wing. The newly re-designed wing at the iconic Manhattan museum will hold modern and contemporary art, as well as photographs, drawings and prints. The Met has been seeking to revamp the current modern and contemporary galleries for more than a decade. The project will create 80,000 square feet of galleries and public space at an estimated cost of about $500 million.The museum said “through flexible gallery spaces, the wing will emphasize the interconnectedness of space and time and suggest a non-chronological narrative.”ADVERTISEMENTThe museum quoted Escobedo as saying “The Met is one of the most relevant sites for culture on a global scale, and it is an honor to be selected for this historic architectural reimagining.”“The Tang Wing presents an opportunity to give new life to the Museum’s art from the 20th and 21st century; to celebrate the dynamics we can find within art of different times, geographies, and ideologies,” Escobedo wrote.TravelUK to end all COVID-19 travel rules ahead of Easter break2 killed, 18 injured in gas explosion at Mexican resortUS extends mask rule for travel while weighing new approachOwner of Cog Railway proposes lodging on Mount WashingtonEscobedo founded a Mexico City architectural group under her own name in 2006.
