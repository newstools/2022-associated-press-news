SEATTLE (AP) — Crystal Mountain Resort in Washington state said Thursday that an unlimited ski and snowboard season pass for the next winter will cost hundreds more than this season.The pass will cost $1,699, with a $100 discount for those renewing from this season, a steep increase from the current season in which full-price season passes cost $999, The Seattle Times reported. The news coincided with the announcement of a major capital investment in the busy ski area near Mount Rainier National Park by owner Alterra Mountain Company. Notably, the new Crystal Legend Pass will not be a member of the Ikon family, which provides access to some 45 ski destinations worldwide. It will cost an additional $300 to add an Ikon Pass onto the new all-access Crystal pass. ADVERTISEMENTCrystal announced the price hike in tandem with a five-year capital plan to invest $100 million in the resort, including 700 new parking spaces, a 100-room hotel, unspecified new trail and lift upgrades, new off-site employee housing and two new base lodges. The infrastructure investment will begin in April, when the resort intends to break ground on a $25 million, 25,114-square-foot lodge with new dining, retail and ticket-sales facilities.Passholders next season also will pay for parking unless they carpool.
