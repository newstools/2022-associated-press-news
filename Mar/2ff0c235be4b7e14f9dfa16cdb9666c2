NEW YORK (AP) — If the next All-Star Game in Major League Baseball goes deep into the night, a slugger may get a chance to decide it by going deep — in a Home Run Derby.That’s right, say going, going, goodbye to extra innings in the Midsummer Classic. Instead, bring on Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Shohei Ohtani, Fernando Tatis Jr., Bryce Harper and the big boppers for a winner-take-all blast-off.Because buried deep in the 182-page memorandum of understanding signed Thursday by MLB and the players’ association is a radical new method of potentially deciding the All-Star Game.“If the All-Star Game remains tied after nine innings, the game will be decided by a Home Run Derby between the teams, subject to the parties’ agreement on details and format,” reads exhibit 13, titled “Tentative Agreement — All-Star Game and Home Run Derby.”And hear this, fans: As part of the overall agreement, “the parties agree to discuss further details and logistics of a potential mid-All-Star Game concert.”ADVERTISEMENTPlus, a new flavor to MLB’s international mix — there will be a regular-season game in Paris in 2025.Dated March 1 and obtained by The Associated Press, the page about the All-Star home derby was signed by MLB senior counsel Kasey Sanossian and players’ association deputy general counsel Matt Nussbaum. It is part of the agreement that led to the end of MLB’s 99-day lockout and the opening of training camps.MLBAP source: All-Star lefty Rodón to Giants for $44M, 2 yrsUnited during negotiations, MLB players divided on dealAP source: Rangers set for reunion with veteran lefty PerezTrevor Bauer's leave extended through March 19 by MLB, unionThis year’s All-Star Game is scheduled for Dodger Stadium on July 19, awarded to Los Angeles after the scheduled 2020 was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.The All-Star Game has gone to extra innings 13 times since it began in 1933, the last two times 10 innings in both 2017 at Miami and 2018 at Washington. Teams running short on pitchers has become an issue as managers try to get most pitchers in the game by the ninth inning.The annual Home Run Derby on the night before the All-Star Game has become one of MLB’s popular events and is not mentioned in the document as changing.The commissioner gained the ability to add a 33rd player to each league’s All-Star roster “in recognition of each player’s career achievements” and could add more than one player “if special circumstances warrant.”In other sections of the agreement:The sides agreed to have regular-season games at Mexico City each May from 2023-26, at London in June 2023, 2024 and 2026, at Paris in June 2025 and at San Juan, Puerto Rico, in September 2025 and 2026.

The sides also agreed to a joint investigation whether contaminated meat products in the Dominican Republic could cause positive tests for the performance-enhancing substances Boldenone and Nandrolone.MLB and players also agreed to a revised “Workplace Code of Conduct” that states: “If you see an individual harassing or discriminating against someone, tell that person to stop and report it to your field manager, your general manager, the commissioner’s office or players’ association.”Harassment is defined as “any verbal, physical or visual behavior directed at another individual because of a protected characteristic tahat (i) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading humiliating or offensive environment or (ii) materially interferes with an individual’s work performance.”A section prohibiting production, distribution, receipt or possession of child pornography was added to the Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy.Teams must be scheduled for seven off days after July 31, including three after Aug. 31.Footwear restrictions were loosened, provided they comply with permitted commercial marks and are not offensive.The annual winter meeting draft of unprotected players, not held due to the lockout, is considered canceled.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
