COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Police in Ohio’s capital city shot and wounded a man Friday who was firing at vehicles along a busy stretch of Interstate 71. The action by Columbus police came after multiple drivers reported that someone on the side of the highway next to a car was firing at passing vehicles headed north shortly before 10 a.m., according to Sgt. James Fuqua, a police spokesperson. Video from a driver posted by Columbus TV stations show the man shooting at police who then returned fire. At least three cars were hit by the suspect’s initial gunfire.The man was taken to the hospital in critical condition after the attack, said Fuqua, who added that police were trying to confirm his identity. A woman was inside the man’s car, and police are investigating whether the attack stemmed from “a domestic incident,” Fuqua said.
