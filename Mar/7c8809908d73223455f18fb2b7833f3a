MARCOUSSIS, France (AP) — Winger Damian Penaud returns in the only change to Grand Slam-chasing France for its Six Nations match with England in Paris on Saturday.Having recovered from a COVID-19 infection, Penaud replaced Yoram Moefana, who damaged his knee last Friday as they beat Wales 13-9 in Cardiff to remain unbeaten.The one change on the bench in the team named Thursday saw lock Romain Taofifenua replacing Matthis Lebel. Taofifenua also missed the Wales match because of a positive coronavirus test.Ben Youngs, England’s record appearance-maker with 116 caps, regained his place at scrumhalf in one of five changes in personnel for the game, which comes a week after the team played with 14 men almost the whole of the 32-15 loss to Ireland that knocked the English out of title contention.Youngs is preferred to Harry Randall, while George Furbank returned at fullback and prop Will Stuart, lock Nick Isiekwe and flanker Sam Underhill came into the pack.ADVERTISEMENTIt will be Underhill’s first appearance for England since the November tests, following illness and a hip injury. He replaced the injured Tom Curry.SportsCollins provides spark, Michigan beats Colorado State 75-63Providence snaps South Dakota State's streak at 21 in NCAALet's play!
