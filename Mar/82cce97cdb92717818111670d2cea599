Opener Ishan Kishan’s 81 not out off 48 balls had helped Mumbai Indians reach 177-5 in 20 overs after being asked to bat at Brabourne Stadium.“I thought it was a good score. It didn’t look like a pitch where you can get 170-plus at the start but we played well in the middle (overs) and finished well,” Mumbai captain Rohit Sharma said. “But we didn’t bowl according to our plans.” Mumbai made a superb start with Kishan and Sharma putting on 67 runs for the first wicket.ADVERTISEMENTSharma scored 41 off 32, including four fours and two sixes, before he was caught off Kuldeep Yadav (3-18).Kishan, the left-handed opener bought by Mumbai Indians for almost $2 million, reached his half-century off 34 balls.CricketWest Indies crushes England in 3rd test to win series 1-0England reaches World Cup semis; South Africa ousts IndiaNew Zealand beats Pakistan at Women's World CupInjured Steve Smith out of white-ball series in PakistanOverall, Kishan faced 48 deliveries and hit 11 fours and two sixes.
