HONOLULU (AP) — Honolulu officials are looking at new ways to regulate short-term vacation rentals in residential areas to address not only parking concerns but the need to create affordable, longer-term rentals. A bill approved by the Honolulu City Council’s zoning and planning committee would force those renting to pony up for a 90-day stay instead of the current 30-day minimum. The bill, which addresses concerns about short-term rentals in residential areas, especially Kailua, could go before the full council in April.The bill would also ban tourists from parking on streets near their short-term rentals and require bed-and-breakfast owners to provide one off-street parking spot per bedroom, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports.ADVERTISEMENTIt is the hope of Kailua residents these proposed rules will lower transient renters in neighborhoods, reduce the number of rental vehicles on residential streets and prompt homeowners to open up these vacation homes to affordable long-term rentals.TravelBritish Museum to remove Sackler name from galleriesGuilty plea for man who led outsized Grand Canyon hike group3 US Muslims sue over religious questioning by officersSouthwest will add a fourth fare level to boost revenue“Many of the people who buy property to rent don’t even live on the island anymore, so that’s why people feel the way they do,” Suzette Cruz of Olomana said.However, Cruz said she also sees the other side of the issue: Some locals rely on vacation home rental income to combat Hawaii’s high cost of living.The city’s planning and permitting department also said it plans to hire investigators to look into complaints into the short-term rental market.
