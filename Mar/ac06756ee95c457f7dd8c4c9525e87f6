TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, who sparred with school boards and the federal government over mask mandates during the coronavirus pandemic, announced Thursday he is resigning at the end of April.In a statement, Corcoran, a former Florida House speaker, said he is stepping down to spend more time with his family and offered heavy praise for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who appointed him in 2018.“Governor DeSantis has been the governor Florida deserves — he has unquestionably been the right leader, at the right time, in the greatest state in the nation, and I thank him and the members of the State Board of Education from the bottom of my heart for the faith they have put in me,” Corcoran said.Corcoran, 56, led Florida’s education department as it enforced the governor’s ban on mask mandates in schools, docking school board salaries in districts that disobeyed state policy. The spat drew the attention of federal education officials. The districts eventually eased their masking rules.ADVERTISEMENTDeSantis tapped Corcoran as education commissioner after Corcoran had backed his opponent in the state’s 2018 Republican primary. Corcoran had considered his own run for governor at the time but instead backed DeSantis’ challenger, Adam Putnam, who was considered a shoo-in for the nomination until former President Donald Trump backed DeSantis ahead of the primary.Coronavirus pandemicHow has the COVID-19 pandemic changed after two years?End of COVID funds?
