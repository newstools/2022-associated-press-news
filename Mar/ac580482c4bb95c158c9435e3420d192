LOS ANGELES (AP) — A man who started a brush fire when he threw lit fireworks into a Los Angeles homeless encampment was spared prison on Wednesday and placed into a mental health treatment program. Daniel Nogueira, 28, faced more than a decade behind bars for starting the Aug. 2019 blaze that threatened homes and forced evacuations before it was contained. Superior Court Judge Kerry White agreed with Nogueira’s attorney that he should receive mental health treatment, the Los Angeles Times reported. The attorney, Alan Jackson, had argued that Nogueira has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes it difficult for him to control his impulses. Jackson claimed Nogueria was merely engaged in “horseplay” and did not intend to set a fire.ADVERTISEMENTThe Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office opposed the diversion plan. The DA’s office did not comment on the judge’s decision, the Times said. The fire was the first in a series of 2019 arson attacks that stoked fears at LA County’s numerous homeless encampments. In a six-week span, tents were set ablaze and homeless people said they also had explosives thrown at their dwellings in Glendale, Echo Park and Skid Row, the Times said.Three homeless people were killed in the fires, two of which police said were set by other unhoused people._
