DENVER (AP) — Colorado’s Democrat-led Legislature on Wednesday sent the governor a bill to codify the right to abortion in state law in a party-line response to efforts in other states to limit abortion access as well as pending constitutional challenges to the procedure.Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he will sign the bill into law.Colorado was the first state to decriminalize abortion in 1967, and it allows access to abortion but has nothing in state law guaranteeing it. The bill approved by the state Senate Wednesday after hours of debate would do just that, The Colorado Sun reported.The Reproductive Health Equity Act would guarantee access to reproductive care before and after pregnancy and ban local governments from imposing their own restrictions. It also would declare that fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses have no independent rights under state law.ADVERTISEMENTHealthModerna says its low-dose COVID shots work for kids under 6EXPLAINER: What to know about COVID vaccines for little kids29 hospitalized after London Olympic pool chlorine gas leakCalifornia governor signs law that makes abortions cheaperDemocrats introduced the bill as a direct response to the Supreme Court’s consideration of a Mississippi case that could overrule Roe v.
