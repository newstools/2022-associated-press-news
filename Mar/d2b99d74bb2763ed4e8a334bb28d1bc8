LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer says people will no longer be required to wear face masks inside city buildings and vehicles. The Courier Journal reports that Fischer’s Friday announcement comes as COVID-19 cases in Jefferson County have continued to decline. The mask mandate was first enacted back in August 2021.Exceptions to the mask policy include employees in healthcare settings, correction employees and visitors and employees who work with unhoused populations.“(Make) no mistake — COVID-19 is still very present in our community and is still sending residents, mostly the unvaccinated, to hospitals,” Fischer said in a statement. “Our progress against COVID-19 wouldn’t be possible without so many residents making the obvious choice to get a free and safe vaccine and boosters offering strong protection against serious illness from the virus.” Statewide, there were nearly 632 new cases per 100,000 people in Kentucky over the past two weeks, which ranks sixth in the country for new cases per capita, according to researchers from from Johns Hopkins.
