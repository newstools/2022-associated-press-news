A pass by Silva for Oyarzabal was deflected back to the former Manchester City midfielder in the area, where he was tripped by Dani Carvajal as he tried to dribble past the defender.Oyarzabal converted the resulting spot kick in the ninth minute by driving a low strike just inside the right post and beyond the reach of Thibaut Courtois.But Madrid finished the first half after a blitz of opportunities while Sociedad could barely touch the ball and was pushed into its own box.Camavinga stunned Sociedad in the 40th when he opted to unleash a long-range strike that took a slight deflection off Asier Illaramendi before beating goalkeeper Álex Remiro. It was Camavinga’s second goal since joining Madrid in the offseason.

In two great strikes it flipped the game around,” Oyarzabal said.Benzema made it 3-1 in the 69th from the penalty spot after a video review adjudged that Aritz Elustondo fouled Vinícius Júnior just inside the area.
