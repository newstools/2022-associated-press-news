PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodia on Thursday announced new measures that significantly ease pandemic-related restrictions for foreign visitors, including dropping mandatory COVID-19 tests for travelers who have been vaccinated.Fully vaccinated travelers no longer need to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken 72 hours before their arrival in Cambodia, according to a statement issued by Health Minister Mam Bunheng. The new regulations go into effect immediately.Foreign visitors also no longer need to take a rapid antigen test for COVID-19 upon arrival, though they are encouraged to do so on their own, the statement said.Visas on arrival are also being restored for entry by air, sea and land, the health minister said.Travelers who are not fully vaccinated are still required to undergo a 14-day quarantine after arriving in Cambodia.Before the pandemic, Cambodia had developed its tourism industry into an important source of revenue and in 2019 welcomed a record high 6.61 million foreign tourists who spent about $5.31 billion, just under 20% of the county’s gross national product, according to Tourism Ministry statistics.ADVERTISEMENTCoronavirus pandemicAsian shares advance after oil climbs back above $100The AP Interview: Health chief warns of COVID funds shortageFacing its first COVID outbreak, Samoa goes on lockdownAsian shares retreat as oil climbs back above $100The number of tourist arrivals in 2020 plunged to 1.31 million, accounting for $1.12 billion in revenue, or just over 4% of GNP.
