JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Anheuser-Busch beer heiress Trudy Busch Valentine on Monday filed to run for U.S. Senate as a Democrat in Missouri.Valentine’s entrance to the race comes days after Republican candidate Eric Greitens was accused of physically assaulting members of his family, which  added fresh urgency to a GOP push to ensure the party doesn’t nominate a damaged candidate who risks losing the otherwise safe Republican seat to a Democrat. Greitens has so far ignored calls to end his campaign from virtually every notable Missouri Republican, including Sen. Roy Blunt, whose retirement left the seat open. Greitens has denied the accusations as “completely fabricated” and “baseless.”ADVERTISEMENTBusch Valentine, daughter of the late chairman of the Anheuser-Busch Companies, also faces a number of Democratic rivals to get the party’s nomination, but the field is thinning. 2022 Midterm electionsCongress residency rule affecting '22 race heads to governorBusch beer heiress Valentine enters Missouri US Senate raceOhio GOP candidates call US Senate race fight for AmericaGross, Coghill say they plan to run for Alaska US House seatFormer state Sen.
