WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Moana Pasifika has dedicated its first win in Super Rugby to “the giants who went before us,” a nod to players of Pacific Islands heritage who have filled the ranks of teams around the world but never previously had a team of their own.Danny Toala scored a try in the fourth minute of golden point extra time Friday to give Moana Pasifika a 24-19 win over the Wellington-based Hurricanes in only its third match of the season.A crushing 59-12 loss to the Hamilton Chiefs a week ago gave little indication Moana Pasifika was on the verge of an historic victory. The team’s debut season has been disrupted by the postponement of three games due to outbreaks of COVID-19, giving Moana Pasifika little chance to build momentum or combinations beyond the training field.Still, they rose to the occasion on their home ground at Auckland’s Mount Smart Stadium, overcoming two yellow cards and a lop-sided penalty count in the first half to be level with the Hurricanes, 7-7 at halftime.ADVERTISEMENTMoana Pasifika then trailed 19-12 with three minutes of normal time remaining. A try to Solomone Funaki from an attacking scrum and the conversion by Christian Leali’ifano tied the scores and forced the match into extra time.RugbyMoana Pasifika celebrate 1st win in Super RugbySuper Rugby Pacific: New Zealand sides Blues, Crusaders winMoana Pasifika beat Hurricanes for 1st Super Rugby winBrumbies seek accuracy, Force seek confidence in Super RugbyToala scored on the end of a long-range attack in the 84th minute to instantly seal his team’s first win. The reaction of his teammates was of utter joy at the realization of their hopes in such difficult circumstances.“We had to work hard from last week, find the pride and the passion,” said Sekope Kepu, the veteran Wallabies prop and Moana Pasifika captain who was one of the yellow card recipients. “We worked really hard in the preseason, and we knew we’ve got it in us. We just needed to string it together.“We still have the discipline to work on but it’s an unbelievable feeling. The giants that went before us...that was for them and our fans.”Moana Pasifika now faces a quick back up with a previously postponed match against the Auckland-based Blues to be played on Tuesday, and a scheduled match against the Blues to go ahead on Saturday.Head coach Aaron Mauger said he sensed in the calmness of his players at halftime their readiness for a big second half performance. He said confidence in the game plan and in each other had been a crucial part of Friday’s victory.But Mauger also warned his team not to get ahead of itself.“It’s one outcome,” Mauger said. “Last week we were beaten by 50 points but we’re certainly going to celebrate this.“It was nice to see our game start to flow and we’ll take a lot of belief into Tuesday night’s game against the Blues as well.”There are new concerns for All Blacks flyhalf Beauden Barrett after he suffered another head injury in Saturday’s match between the Blues and Dunedin-based Highlanders.ADVERTISEMENTBarrett has only recently returned to the field after suffering lingering concussions symptoms from a head knock in New Zealand’s test against Ireland in November.Head coach Leon MacDonald said there was no hesitation in taking Barrett from the field when he was injured in a collision during the Blues’ 32-25 win.“We were never going to take any chances with Beauden,” MacDonald said. “We want to look after his health and make sure he’s well and it was an automatic decision really.”The Christchurch-based Crusaders beat the Chiefs 34-19 to avenge their loss to the Chiefs two weeks earlier.In Australia, the Queensland Reds beat the New South Wales Waratahs 32-20, the Melbourne Rebels beat the Fijian Drua 42-27 for their first win of the season and the ACT Brumbies edged the Western Force 39-38 to stay unbeaten after six games.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
