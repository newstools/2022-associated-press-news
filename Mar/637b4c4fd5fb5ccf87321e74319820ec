In total, he made more than $430,000 through the scheme.Braga obtained photographs from driver’s licenses while making alcohol deliveries for one of the companies, prosecutors said. His involvement netted him about $220,000.Sixteen of those charged in the case have been arrested and three remain at large. Four have now pleaded guilty.
