COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Anti-government protests roiled Sri Lanka’s capital on Tuesday amid demands that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resign, as the country suffers its worst economic crisis within memory.Tens of thousands of people gathered outside of the president’s office in Colombo, led by supporters of the opposition party of the United People’s Force.Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa addressed the demonstration, declaring it marked the beginning of a campaign to oust the government.“You have been suffering now for two years. Can you suffer further?” he told the large crowd carrying signs and anti-government banners.Premadasa described the sitting government as “evil” and blamed it for many of the country’s economic woes.Demonstrators accused the government of mismanaging the economy and creating a foreign exchange crisis that has led to shortages of essentials like fuel, cooking gas, milk powder and medicines.ADVERTISEMENTSri Lanka is struggling to pay for imports as its foreign reserves are at an all-time low.President Rajapaksa is scheduled to address the nation on Wednesday.
