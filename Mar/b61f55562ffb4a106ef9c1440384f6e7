A Texas judge is hearing a case Friday on whether to prevent state officials from investigating reports of transgender youth receiving gender confirming care as child abuse.District Judge Amy Clark Meachum will hear from attorneys for the state and the parents of a 16-year-old girl who were being investigated by the Department of Family and Protective Services over such care. Meachum last week blocked the investigation and is considering whether to block similar investigations of other families. The parents sued over the investigation and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s directive that DFPS investigate reports of transgender youth receiving gender confirming care as child abuse. ADVERTISEMENTThe lawsuit  marked the first report of parents being investigated following Abbott’s directive and an earlier nonbinding legal opinion by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton labeling certain gender-confirming treatments as “child abuse.” DFPS said it has opened nine investigations since Abbott’s directive and Paxton’s opinion.HealthTwo grueling years later, world takes cautious steps forwardFacing Purdue owners brings pain, closure for opioid victimsBiden relief plan: Major victory gets mixed one-year reviewsBy the numbers: the giant COVID relief package, 1 year laterThe American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal sued on behalf of the parents.
