CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The New Hampshire House on Thursday voted to repeal the state’s paid family medical leave program less than a year after it was signed into law, saying that it’s no longer needed because private insurance carriers have now filed similar plans in the state. The vote to repeal passed on a vote of 172-164 in the Republican-led House. “During public hearings for this bill, the Labor committee learned that private insurance will be developing plan offerings independent of the government’s family leave plan,” Rep. Len Turcotte, R-Barrington, said in a statement. He added, “The government program has yet to be implemented, so now is the time to repeal it and allow the private sector to take the lead.”Some committee members had said the plan is “financially exclusionary” to lower-income residents and needed work, but they opposed repealing it. The bill now goes to the Senate.
