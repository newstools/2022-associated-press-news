London (AP) — In 2020, Rebel Wilson flew from Australia to present the best director trophy at the BAFTA Film Awards.Her humorous speech, which referenced a lack of women nominated in the category and bemoaned that box office flop “Cats” was overlooked entirely, was one of the funniest moments of the night.Now, Wilson is heading back to BAFTA where she’s been asked to host the ceremony Sunday at London’s Royal Albert Hall.“I’m very pumped, very pumped for Sunday for the BAFTAs, but definitely like a pretty nervous because like it’s a live event and it’s just like it’s a one and done situation,” she says. “Even though I’ve been thinking of jokes and stuff, I’ve never really said them out loud to anybody... So we’ll say, fingers crossed.”And these jokes will definitely be at the expense of the star-studded audience, albeit in a loving way.“It is tradition to make a few quips about people. And they’re pretty successful people, which is why they’re there and been invited to the BAFTAs,” she explains.ADVERTISEMENT“At the end of the day, like I do love them, and I love the films that they’ve made,″ she says. ” But yeah I, as the host, you have to kind of make a couple of jokes as well.”EntertainmentYoung Ukrainian dancers, trapped abroad, get Paris residencyTony Awards to return to return to regular date and placeNew Oliver Jeffers book scheduled to come out Oct. 4Bob Dylan book on 'Modern Song' to come out in NovemberWilson is eschewing the popular practice of having multiple costume changes because she wants to concentrate on what’s happening during the ceremony.

Maybe I should use the BAFTAs as just a casting call for ’Cats 2.”
