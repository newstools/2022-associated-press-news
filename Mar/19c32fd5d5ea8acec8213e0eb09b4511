Howard Hawks is a founder of Omaha-based energy company Tenaska and is a former member and chairman of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents.The project will add 42,000 feet to the museum. Joslyn executive director and CEO Jack Becker has said the closure in necessary for the protection of staff and valuable art during the height of the construction phase.
