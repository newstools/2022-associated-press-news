Marizanne Kapp made a nerveless 36 not out from 35 balls as South Africa beat New Zealand by two wickets with three balls remaining Thursday to stay unbeaten after four matches at the Women’s Cricket World Cup.At Hamilton, New Zealand, half centuries to Laura Wolvaardt and captain Sune Luus put South Africa on the road to victory as it chased down New Zealand’s total of 228 and rejoined Australia atop the points table in the tournament.But it was the veteran Kapp, who had taken 2-44 during the New Zealand innings, who was left to steer her team home in an increasingly nervous run chase.“I think these games have to stop now, I’m tired,” the 32-year-old Kapp said. “Again it was a team effort, again we weren’t at our best but I believe the perfect game is just around the corner.“I’m always nervous, I’m not going to lie. (Wolvaardt and Luus) batted well today but you can’t get too relaxed because, as you saw, the game can change like that. Luckily today we got away with the win and I’m happy to be standing on the winning side.”ADVERTISEMENTSouth Africa needed 72 to win from 95 balls when Wolvaardt was out for 67 after her third consecutive half century at the tournament.
