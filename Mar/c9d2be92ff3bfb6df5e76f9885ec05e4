ST. JOHN’S, Antigua (AP) — Late-bloomer Nkrumah Bonner’s career-best century anchored West Indies to a 62-run lead against England on an attritional third day of the first test at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Thursday.The home side batted all day to overturn a 109-run deficit, and Bonner almost endured, too. He was out just two overs from stumps for 123 after almost 10 hours at the crease.The West Indies, in reply to England’s 311, resumed on 202-4 and reached stumps at 373-9. On a sluggish pitch on which it was hard to bowl and bat, the West Indies eked out only 171 runs from the day’s 90.1 overs.Bonner made his test debut just over a year ago, but at 33 has been making up for lost time.He absorbed England’s pressure with ease and rode considerable luck. During the day, he was dropped on 73, survived umpire’s calls on 102 and 112, and got an out overturned on review on 121.ADVERTISEMENTHis overnight stand with Jason Holder finished early on 79, but Bonner found regular partnerships with the tail to frustrate England. Bonner shared 73 with Joshua Da Silva, 44 with Kemar Roach, and 46 with Veerasammy Permaul.Holder added only two to his overnight score before trying to leave Ben Stokes but edging behind on 45. Stokes, who barely bowled in the Ashes because of injury, finished the day committing 28 overs, his most in an innings in six years.SportsMLB players vote to end lockout, salvaging 162-game seasonEXPLAINER: MLB's lockout is over, so what now?Frenzy Part II?

He jumped into Roach’s arms.Roach was run out for 15, but Bonner snuffed out England’s renewed hopes of a breakthrough.Bonner was almost at stumps when England, in desperation, gave the ball to part-time offspinner Dan Lawrence, who induced from Bonner the slightest edge behind.He’d lasted 355 balls, hit a dozen fours and one six, and received a standing ovation.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
