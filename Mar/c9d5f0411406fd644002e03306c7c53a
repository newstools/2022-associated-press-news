LONDON (AP) — All four Grand Slam tennis tournaments will now use a 10-point tiebreaker when matches reach 6-6 in the final set.The Grand Slam Board announced the trial move, taking effect immediately, on behalf of the Australian, French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon on Wednesday.“The Grand Slam Board’s decision is based on a strong desire to create greater consistency in the rules of the game at the Grand Slams, and thus enhance the experience for the players and fans alike,” it said.The Australian Open already uses the 10-point tiebreaker. The French Open, which begins May 22, was the only major to not use a deciding tiebreaker. Wimbledon had employed a seven-point tiebreaker from 12-12, and the U.S. Open used a seven-point tiebreaker from 6-6.“Under this trial, if the score reaches six games all in the final set, the match winner(s) will be the first player(s) to win 10 points with an advantage of two or more points,” the Grand Slam Board said.ADVERTISEMENTAmelie Mauresmo, a two-time Grand Slam champion who is now the tournament director of the French Open, said the goal was consistency.“The central idea of the four Grand Slam tournaments was absolutely to line up. That was really the priority,” Mauresmo said. “For the sake of consistency, for the understanding of the fans, the players, the media.”SportsDjokovic, Russian players expected to compete at French OpenMLB drops regular COVID tests, can move games for healthAP All-America team includes milestone for Kentucky's HowardChicago Cubs owners launching bid to buy EPL club ChelseaMauresmo added that the move will help preserve “players, the interest of the spectators and TV viewers. We could no longer afford to operate differently.”The plan has been approved by the Rules of Tennis Committee governed by the International Tennis Federation and applies to all Grand Slams across qualifying, men’s singles and doubles, women’s singles and doubles, wheelchair and junior events in singles.Rule changes were sought after John Isner beat Nicolas Mahut 70-68 in the final set of their first round match at Wimbledon in 2010. The match lasted 11 hours, 5 minutes and stretched over three days.“The Grand Slam Board plans to review the trial during the course of a full Grand Slam year, in consultation with the WTA, ATP and ITF, before applying for any permanent rule change,” it added.___More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
