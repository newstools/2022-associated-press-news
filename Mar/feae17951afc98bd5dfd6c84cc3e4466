DOVER, Del. (AP) — Some Delaware lawmakers are itching to ensure that cats can keep scratching.A bill introduced in the state House on Thursday would prohibit cat owners from declawing their pets except for “therapeutic purposes.” That definition means addressing a physical or medical condition that compromises the health or well-being of a cat. It does not include cosmetic or aesthetic reasons, or reasons of convenience, like protecting your furniture.It also does not include addressing or preventing potential medical problems in humans, such as cat-scratch fever.Supporters of the ban say declawing hurts the cat and leaves it unable to defend itself.Cat owners could still file or trim their pets’ nails, but cutting or modifying the tendon in a paw to prevent the extension of a claw or normal functioning of one or more claws would be outlawed.Violation of the declawing ban would be a civil offense carrying a fine of up to $1,000.ADVERTISEMENTVeterinarians and veterinary technicians would be subject to professional discipline for illegally declawing a cat, which would be considered animal cruelty.The Delaware bill was introduced on the same day that House lawmakers in Maryland approved a declawing ban, under which veterinarians could be fined up to $5,000 for a first offense and up to $10,000 for a second offense. They could also lose their license to practice.Opioids'Scum of the earth': Drug victims face Purdue Pharma ownersWhat opioid victims told Sacklers when they got the chanceDozen doctors get prison in health care fraud, opioid schemeJudge favors boosting Sackler payment in Purdue Pharma dealThe Maryland Senate approved its own declawing bill earlier in the legislative session.

Larry Hogan.Currently, New York is the only state to have banned cat declawing.
