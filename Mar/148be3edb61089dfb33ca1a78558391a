PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) — An entire block of 15 family homes in Northern California was purchased by a single buyer for $10 million.The cottage-style homes built in the 1920s are located on Laurel Avenue in Pacific Grove and include a mix of studios, and one and two bedrooms, KSBW-TV reported. The buyer owns multiple historic properties in Pacific Grove and wishes to be identified as Whispering Pines, LLC, a nod to the home’s history, said Debby Beck, the real estate broker who represented the buyer. Fourteen of the fifteen cottages were built in 1924 by Dr. Andrew Jackson Hart, the owner of Hart Mansion, one of the most well-known landmarks on the Monterey Peninsula. The homes, bounded by Cedar, Pine, Locust and Laurel Street, became known as the Whispering Pines of Pacific Grove. Beck said the new owner has no plans of subdividing the block given the historic significance of the homes.
