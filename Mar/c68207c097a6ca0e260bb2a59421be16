OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — Washington state is expanding its program to distribute free COVID-19 tests throughout the state.The Seattle Times reported that officials with the state Department of Health said that starting Wednesday, sayyescovidhometest.org — the site that allows people to order free tests to be delivered to their homes — will allow up to two orders per household every month while supplies last.“Home tests are an excellent public health tool that help us know quickly and conveniently if we have COVID-19 so that we can take action to care for ourselves,” said Lacy Fehrenbach, the state’s deputy secretary of COVID-19 response.When the state Department of Health launched the site in January, each household could only order one kit, which contains up to five tests, due to limited supply.The state quickly ran out of tests and had to temporarily halt distribution while the department restocked its kits, but the site has since reopened.
