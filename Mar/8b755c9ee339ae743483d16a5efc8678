Even if the Falcons re-sign Gage, who filled in as the No. 1 target for Matt Ryan while Ridley missed most of last season while addressing mental health issues, wide receiver joins edge rusher, cornerback and offensive tackle as most pressing on a lengthy list of offseason needs. The Falcons must be bargain shoppers and could find it difficult to re-sign such key players as Patterson and Oluokun even after releasing outside linebacker Dante Fowler and offensive tackle Matt Gono. Fowler was the pass rush leader on a defense which ranked last in the league with 18 sacks.AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $4.2 million.___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
