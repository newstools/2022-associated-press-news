NEW YORK (AP) — Target pushed through headwinds — from inflation to congested ports — to deliver solid results for the three-month period that included the crucial holiday shopping season.Fourth-quarter profit rose nearly 12%, sales increased 9.4% and the Minneapolis retailer on Tuesday released an upbeat revenue outlook for 2022. Shares jumped more than 5% before the opening bell. Retailers are facing rising costs for everything from labor to shipping as supply chain backups hit companies worldwide. Yet Target, because of its size, was able to charter vessels and fill its shelves ahead of the holiday shipping crunch.Net income for the quarter that ended Jan. 29 reached $1.54 billion, or $3.21 per share. Adjusted earnings per share for the latest quarter was $3.19, easily topping the $2.85 that industry analysts were looking for, according to FactSet. It also topped last year’s fourth-quarter profit of $1.38 billion, or $2.73 per share. ADVERTISEMENTRevenue was $31 billion compared with Wall Street projections of $31.32 billion. The company registered an 8.9% increase in sales at stores opened at least a year, while online sales rose 9.2%. More than 95% of Target’s fourth-quarter sales were fulfilled by its stores.
