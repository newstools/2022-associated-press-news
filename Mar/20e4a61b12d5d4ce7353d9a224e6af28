The sate has said about 90% of those districts had dropped the requirement as of Monday.Meanwhile, Connecticut lawmakers are considering a bill that would make forging vaccination cards a crime.The General Assembly’s Public Safety Committee is holding a public hearing Friday on proposed legislation that says anyone who “falsely makes, completes or alters” a vaccination record they know to be forged would be committing a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $2,000 fine.Last year at a rally supporting a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate, a box with dozens of fake vaccination cards was left out with the handwritten message: “Lost your cards?” The box was seized by State Capitol Police.____Associated Press writer Susan Haigh contributed to this report.
