LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Brandon Schneider signed a new four-year contract with Kansas on Wednesday that will pay the Big 12 coach of the year $400,000 annually along with numerous benefits and incentives through the 2025-26 season.Schneider led the Jayhawks (20-8) to a fifth-place finish in the Big 12 this season after they were voted last in the league’s preseason poll. They won seven straight games earlier this season, the program’s longest streak since 1997, and the 20 wins in the regular season were their most since the 1999-2000 season.Kansas opens the Big 12 Tournament against fourth-seeded Oklahoma on Friday in Kansas City, Missouri.“Brandon has worked tirelessly to get this program back to where it should be competing at the highest level of the Big 12 with an opportunity to make a statement deep into March,” Kansas athletic director Travis Goff said. “Brandon has also assembled an outstanding coaching staff that leads, mentors and develops our young women both on and off the court.ADVERTISEMENT“While we love the progress on the court, our emphasis at the University of Kansas extends to the character of the head coach, the way in which they lead and develop our student-athletes in a comprehensive way, as well as how they represent our program day-in and day-out.
