LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — Russian and Belarusian swimmers were banned Thursday from competing at the world championships because of the war in Ukraine.The sport’s governing body, known as FINA, had broken with most other organizations by continuing to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete, though as “neutral athletes” without national symbols.“Following the review of an independent risk assessment, the FINA Bureau met today and confirmed that athletes and officials from Russia and Belarus will not take part (in the world championships),” FINA said.The event, which will be held in Hungary in June and July, includes swimming, diving, water polo and artistic swimming.FINA added that Russia responded by withdrawing from all events on this year’s calendar. Russia was stripped of hosting the world short-course championships in Kazan in December and FINA is now seeking a new host.ADVERTISEMENTRussian and Belarusian athletes already have been suspended from sports including soccer, track, gymnastics, skiing and ice skating because of the invasion of Ukraine.FINA is also pursuing a disciplinary case against swimmer Evgeny Rylov, who appeared at a rally in Moscow last week in support of Russian forces and President Vladimir Putin.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
