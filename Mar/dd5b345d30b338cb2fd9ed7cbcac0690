Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a U.S. Supreme Court case over a Mississippi law that seeks to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.Justices heard arguments in December, and the Mississippi attorney general’s office asked them to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

Dobbs said one lie is that his son, who is also a physician, receives a World Bank-funded kickback when Dobbs urges people to get vaccinated.“I get zero $ from promoting vaccination,” Dobbs wrote on Twitter.In the Health Department news release Tuesday, Dobbs said he would like to return to the academic world to teach about public health and infectious diseases.Dobbs has held faculty positions at colleges and universities in the Southeast, including at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. He was state epidemiologist before moving into the top job at the Health Department in 2018.The health officer is chosen by the state Board of Health and confirmed by the state Senate. The board chairman, Dr. Thad Waites, said in the release Tuesday that board members have supported Dobbs.“I speak for all of us when I say that we have truly appreciated his professionalism, sterling personality, and stellar leadership throughout his tenure, but especially during COVID,” Waites said. “He has been a wonderful asset to Mississippi.”
