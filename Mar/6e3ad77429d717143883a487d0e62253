BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A judge has banned a man from working as a contractor in North Dakota for at least five years after his business failed to complete a number of home improvement projects. Attorney General Drew Wrigley announced Friday that Burleigh County Judge David Reich on Tuesday ordered Matthew Holden’s flooring business dissolved, barred him from doing business as a contractor in the state and ordered him to pay $36,420 in restitution to 10 consumers. Holden can ask a court to allow him to work as a contractor again after five years.According to court documents, Holden took advance payments from homeowners in Burleigh and Morton counties last year for home improvement projects, including flooring materials and installation, and then didn’t deliver the materials or finish the work.
