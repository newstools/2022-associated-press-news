BOGALUSA, La. (AP) — Ten people were wounded in a shooting following a Mardi Gras parade in eastern Louisiana and a man has been arrested on charges including attempted first-degree murder, police said.The Bogalusa Police Department called the Magic City Carnival Association parade on Saturday “rather peaceful” but said in a Tuesday statement that “the peacefulness would not last into the night.” Patrolling officers heard gunshots that evening and then found that multiple people had been harmed. An officer took two victims to an emergency room, and others were transported by ambulance or personally owned vehicles. Police said the gunshot wounds ranged from minor to serious but there were no fatalities.Detectives determined that Less Dillon began firing from a vehicle at people in front of a store. Bystanders shot back, and the 41-year-old was airlifted to a hospital with serious injuries.ADVERTISEMENTAuthorities believe the motive that led to the shooting was related to domestic violence and that most of the victims were unintended bystanders, according to the statement. Several vehicles and a storefront were also damaged by gunshots.Dillon was booked into the Washington Parish jail on Wednesday and is being held on a $175,000 bond, online sheriff’s office records show. It wasn’t immediately clear if he had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.
