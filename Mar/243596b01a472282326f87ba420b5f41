WAHPETON, N.D. (AP) — A man who started a fire at the Richland County corrections center was seen on surveillance video lighting some sort of device before fleeing, according to sheriff’s officials. Sheriff Larry Leshovsky said it’s difficult to identify the device that held the material that was set on fire about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday in the lobby of the Richland County Law Enforcement Center in Wahpeton. The device was taken to a federal lab for examination. Authorities have not said whether the person on video surveillance could be identified. Officials are still looking for that person. The fire caused moderate damage to the lobby area and smoke throughout the building, KFGO  reported. Fifteen inmates were transported by bus to jails in Cass and Barnes County counties and were expected to be returned to Richland County on Wednesday. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation are assisting Richland County officials with the case.
