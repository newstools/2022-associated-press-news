NEW YORK (AP) — Former Major League Baseball players Jonny Gomes, Adrián González, Geovany Soto and Nick Swisher are going on a home run derby tour to London; Seoul, South Korea; and Mexico City.MLB said Wednesday the four will participate in Home Run Derby X at London’s Crystal Palace Park on July 9, in Seoul on Sept. 17 and in Mexico City on Oct. 15. Venues for Seoul and Mexico City will be announced later.The four former stars will be on four teams that include players from women’s baseball and softball, development systems and content creators. MLB said the competition will take place on a “reduced version of a baseball field” with home plate mounted on a stage and the pitcher’s mound on a podium.Each batter will get to swing at 25 pitches and take up to 10 of them, with home runs earning a point and catches by players in the outfield gaining one point for the defense. There are additional points for streaks and methods MLB said are inspired by video games.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
