BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Airline passenger traffic at North Dakota’s eight commercial airports improved significantly in January compared to the same month last year, but still remain below pre-pandemic levels. According to the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission, 73,117 passengers used the airports in January, 73% more than the same month in 2021, but below nearly 100,000 passengers in January 2020, about two months before COVID-19 struck. “Air service demand is significantly stronger than where we were one year ago; however it is also still approximately 18% below 2019’s pre-pandemic passenger counts,” state Aeronautics Commissioner Kyle Wanner said.“Airlines continue to cite difficulties with their ability to increase flights and capacity due to workforce shortages and fleet availability,” he said. “These challenges as well as a sustained lower demand for business travel are all factors that contribute to the difficulty for passenger numbers to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in the short term.”ADVERTISEMENTAirports in Bismarck, Fargo, Grand Forks, Minot, Devils Lake, Jamestown, Dickinson and Williston all experienced an increase in passenger traffic last month, ranging from 54% in Bismarck to 154% in Dickinson, the Bismarck Tribune reported. Hector International in Fargo, the state’s largest airport, saw an increase of 87%. Williston’s rise was 72%.All airports but Jamestown and Devils Lake saw declines from January 2019. Bismarck’s drop was 25%.
