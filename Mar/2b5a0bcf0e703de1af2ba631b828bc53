Bale scored both of Wales’ goals, a sensational free kick into the top corner in the 25th and a shot on the turn in the 51st.SoccerPortugal beats Turkey 3-1 to move closer to World CupItaly to miss World Cup again after loss to North MacedoniaWithout Ibrahimovic, Sweden reaches World Cup playoff finalItaly misses 2nd straight World Cup in rapid fall from graceWales will host either Scotland or Ukraine in a playoff final in June.In the other four-team qualifying bracket, Sweden beat the Czech Republic 1-0 after extra time and will travel to play Poland on Tuesday for a spot in the tournament in Qatar.
