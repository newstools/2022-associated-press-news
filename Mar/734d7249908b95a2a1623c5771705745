Ben McLemore had 28 points off the bench, including eight 3-pointers, for the Trail Blazers. Portland has lost four straight and sits outside the playoff picture at 12th in the West.

Portland said rookie forward Trendon Watford sustained a bone bruise to his left femur in the team’s 115-98 loss at home to Houston. Fellow rookie Greg Brown III had a corneal abrasion to his left eye. The Thunder also played just eight players. Before the game, coach Mark Daigneault said guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will miss the rest of the season because of right ankle soreness. Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 24.5 points, five rebounds and 5.9 assists in 56 games this season. Daigneault said there was no reason to bring Gilgeous-Alexander back because there are so few games left in the season. The Blazers led 61-58 at the break after a surprisingly competitive first half, given all the injuries. The Thunder led by as many as seven in the first half, but Portland was able to stay close and finally pulled in front late when McLemore’s 3-pointer made it 60-58. McLemore hit another 3 to put Portland ahead 83-78 in the third quarter. TIP-INSThunder: Tre Mann (right hamstring strain) was a late scratch. ...
