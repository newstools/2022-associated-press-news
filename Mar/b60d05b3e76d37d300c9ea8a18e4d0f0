That ended the night for Koskinen.It didn’t start off any better for Smith, who was beaten between the pads by Tkachuk at 7:39 when an Oilers turnover in their own end allowed Gaudreau to find Tkachuk in behind the defense.Brandishing a dangerous power play, the Oilers roared back again, making it 6-5 when they converted a two-man advantage they got when Erik Gudbranson was sent off for high-sticking three seconds into Andrew Mangiapane’s penalty.Draisaitl’s third of the game at 9:18 of the second and 47th of the season brought about 50 hats onto the ice from the boisterous Oilers supporters scattered throughout the red-clad crowd.Early in the third, Markstrom robbed Evander Kane after he was set up in front on a great passing sequence with Connor McDavid and Jesse Puljujarvi that would have tied it. Calgary then pushed the puck up ice, with Gaudreau setting up Lindholm for his second of the night.The Flames added an insurance goal just more than three minutes later when Backlund notched his second, whipping a shot inside the post.Edmonton scored 32 seconds into the game when Brassard deflected Bouchard’s point shot past Markstrom, but the Oilers’ only lead lasted less than five minutes.Lindholm was sent in alone on a pass from Tkachuk and he went to his backhand, putting a shot under the crossbar.The Flames then surged in front on goals 16 seconds apart.NOTES: Noah Hanifin played his 500th NHL game.
