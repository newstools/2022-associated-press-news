Merced police said investigators were working to identify the body. They did not release the cause of death.Johnson was being held for investigation of murder. She will be transferred to the Merced County Jail to face charges, police said.A warrant was issued for Jackson’s arrest. Police said he is known to frequent the Bay Area.
