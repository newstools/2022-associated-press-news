A family took him in, but returned him when he couldn’t get along with that’s family’s cats. The shelter had been searching for a new home for the dog when it shared a photo of him on Facebook in February. Tinae’s daughter who lives in New York, saw another social media post and set out to bring about the reunion, which was captured on video on March 3.Federico, who started working at the shelter a year ago, said it’s the first time she remembers a situation like this one.
