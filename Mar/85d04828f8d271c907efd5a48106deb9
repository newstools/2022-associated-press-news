AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — A Maine legislative committee has failed to compromise on the provisions of a utility reform bill that seeks to introduce new accountability measures for electric utilities in the state.The senate Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee members were split three ways on the bill in a vote Friday, the Portland Press Herald reported. That means the full state legislature will consider the different versions of the bill with a vote in the senate expected next month, the newspaper reported. The Maine house will then consider it.Last month, Gov. Janet Mills introduced the bill that attempts to fix utility performance issues by forcing companies to meet regulatory standards for customer service, complaints, reliability and power restoration. If companies fail multiple quarterly reports, they could face a $1 million financial penalty and eventually a potential forced sale.
