TOKYO (AP) — The price of oil jumped more than $12 a barrel and shares were sharply lower Monday as the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia. Brent crude oil surged more than 10%, while benchmark U.S. crude was up $10 at more than $125 a barrel. Stock futures in the U.S. and Europe also dropped. The price of gold, which is viewed as an investor safe haven in times of crisis, jumped $26 an ounce to $1,992.90. The latest market turmoil followed a warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin  that Ukrainian statehood was imperiled as Russian forces battered strategic locations. A temporary cease-fire in two Ukrainian cities failed over the weekend — and both sides blamed each other.Oil prices came under additional pressure after  Libya’s national oil company  said an armed group had shut down two crucial oil fields. The move caused the country’s daily oil output to drop by 330,000.
