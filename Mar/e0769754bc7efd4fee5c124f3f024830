PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine’s state government said Wednesday it is rescinding a recommendation for universal masking in schools and child care facilities.The Maine Department of Health and Human Services and Maine Department of Education said they are considering mask use optional in those settings starting March 9. The final say will rest at the local level, as local school boards have authority about mask requirements in the state’s school districts.The decision to end the mask recommendation comes as the state is experiencing reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations, fewer school outbreaks and reduced virus levels in wastewater, state officials said. The state had an indoor mask requirement earlier in the pandemic, but it was rescinded in June 2021, when the state started recommending U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance.The state is continuing to recommend COVID-19 vaccinations, and that people make decisions about mask use that they believe are in the best interest of their health and considerate of the people around them, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said.ADVERTISEMENT“At this point in the pandemic, the focus of state government remains on maintaining the critical functions of everyday life for Maine people, including preserving hospital capacity, keeping schools open, supporting businesses, and providing Maine people with the tools to keep themselves healthy, like COVID-19 vaccines and tests,” Mills said.Coronavirus pandemicMaine to rescind school mask recommendation on March 9Philadelphia lifts indoor mask mandate for most settingsEconomic dangers from Russia's invasion ripple across globeDemocratic leader on leave, still pushes for remote accessThe state is still recommending universal masking in medical facilities, long-term care facilities and other congregate living facilities, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.Maine is one of the most vaccinated states in the nation for COVID-19.
