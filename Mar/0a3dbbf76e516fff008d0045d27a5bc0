TORONTO (AP) — Erik Kallgren made 35 saves to earn a shutout in his first NHL start as the Toronto Maple Leafs blanked the Dallas Stars 4-0 on Tuesday night.John Tavares had a goal and an assist for Toronto (38-17-5). Rasmus Sandin and Ondrej Kase also scored, while Mitch Marner and Morgan Rielly had two assists apiece. Ilya Mikheyev added an empty-netter.Jake Oettinger stopped 36 shots for Dallas (32-23-3).With top goalie Jack Campbell out with a rib injury — he was also struggling badly before getting hurt — and a wobbly Petr Mrazek the Maple Leafs’ only other option, Kallgren got the nod for a team that entered with an NHL-worst 88.1% save percentage at 5 on 5 since Jan. 1.The 25-year-old rookie Swede, who made seven saves in relief of Mrazek in Thursday’s 5-4 shootout loss to Arizona in his NHL debut, is the first Maple Leafs goalie to record a shutout in his first NHL start since Garret Sparks on Nov. 30, 2015.ADVERTISEMENTToronto was minus NHL goals leader Auston Matthews after he was suspended two games for a cross-check to the neck of Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin in Sunday’s 5-2 loss to Buffalo at the outdoor Heritage Classic in Hamilton — a game in which Mrazek was badly at fault on the winning goal.NHLSaros stops 35 shots as Predators down Penguins 4-1Kallgren gets shutout in 1st NHL start, Leafs beat Stars 4-0Fox scores in OT to give Rangers 4-3 win over DucksRed-hot Arizona caps eastern swing with 6-3 win vs. MontrealTuesday also marked the first NHL game featuring both Maple Leafs rookie forward Nick Robertson and older brother Jason, who leads the Stars with 30 goals and sits second with 55 points.Sporting a 15-8-1 record with a .904 save percentage for the AHL’s Toronto Marlies in 2021-22, Kallgren got a nice round of applause from the crowd at Scotiabank Arena following a few early stops before the Maple Leafs took a 1-0 lead.Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe, forced to alter his top-six forward group, saw his new No. 1 line connect at 7:22 of the first period when Tavares — occupying Matthews’ No. 1 center role — and Marner found Sandin off the rush for the defenseman to score his fifth on the Maple Leafs’ first shot.The home side made it 2-0 at 11:16 following an offensive zone faceoff when William Nylander’s shot struck Tavares in the skate and slid past Oettinger for the Toronto captain’s 20th.Signed to a two-year, two-way contract in May after helping Vaxjo HC win last season’s Swedish Hockey League title, Kallgren was solid the rest of the period before having to make a pair of nice save on Radek Faska in the waning seconds.Toronto, which had given up at least four goals in six straight games and 10 of its past 12, killed off a trio of penalties in the second period, including a couple stops by Kallgren against Denis Gurianov.Oettinger denied Mikheyev on a breakaway to keep it 2-0 through 40 minutes.Kase made it 3-0 just 52 seconds into the third on a power play when Rielly brought the puck down the right side before feeding the winger in the slot for him to one-time his 13thADVERTISEMENTOettinger kept the Stars within striking distance a few minutes later with an outrageous glove save against the grain on a one-handed deflected effort from Nylander.Dallas pushed with under nine minutes left, but the cool Kallgren was there at every turn to give Toronto some much-needed crease calm for a roster that provided its best defensive effort in weeks before Mikheyev sealed it.UP NEXTStars: At the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday night. Maple Leafs: Host former Toronto goaltender Frederik Andersen and the Carolina Hurricanes on Thursday. Matthews, who has 45 goals in 56 games this season, is eligible to return Saturday in Nashville.___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
