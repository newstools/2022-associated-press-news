RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A judge has granted Richmond permission to hold a second referendum on a proposed casino in November.Voters rejected the $565 million One Casino and Resort project last fall, but according to an order signed by Richmond City Circuit Judge Reilly Marchant, the same proposal will be on ballots again this year, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. The mayor and city council has called for another referendum, citing the tightly contested result and the loss of about $30 million in projected annual tax revenue from the development.“This special economic development opportunity in South Richmond gives the city an additional way to address equity and community wealth gaps,” Mayor Levar Stoney said in a statement Monday. ADVERTISEMENTThe order comes as nearby Petersburg and state Sen. Joe Morrissey seek a casino referendum there. Last month, a Virginia Senate committee rejected legislation allowing a Petersburg casino referendum, but a provision in the Senate’s proposed state budget would temporarily block a second Richmond referendum to allow time for a Petersburg casino study. The General Assembly finished its session, but hasn’t reached an agreement on the state’s next budget.
