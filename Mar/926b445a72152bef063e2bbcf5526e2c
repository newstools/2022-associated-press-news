Hoffman, now with Montreal, scored 65 goals in two seasons with Florida from 2018-20. ... The Panthers have 268 goals, their most in one season. ... Only one team in Panthers history had more wins than this Florida club does, that being the 2015-16 squad that had 47 victories. ... The Canadiens are on pace for the fourth-worst record in team history, and the worst mark by any Montreal club in more than 80 years. Only the 1935-36 (11-26-11), 1925-26 (11-24-1) and 1939-40 (10-33-5) teams were worse.
