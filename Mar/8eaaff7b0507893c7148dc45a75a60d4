TOKYO — Japan denounced Russia on Tuesday over its decision to discontinue peace treaty talks over the disputed Kuril islands and withdraw from joint economic projects in retaliation for Tokyo’s sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The two countries never signed a peace treaty formally ending World War II hostilities because of their dispute over the Russian-held islands north of Hokkaido, which Moscow took at the end of the war.“The latest situation has been all caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters Tuesday. He called Russia’s response “extremely unjustifiable and absolutely unacceptable.”Japan has imposed a series of sanctions on Russia in recent weeks, including freezing some individual assets, banning exports of luxury goods and high-technology equipment to the country and revoking Russia’s most favored nation trade status.ADVERTISEMENT___KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR:— AP video journalist gives riveting first-hand account  of the siege of Mariupol Russia-Ukraine warRussia-Ukraine war: Key things to know about the conflictLive updates: Zelenskyy says Ukraine ready to discuss deal As Mariupol hangs on, the extent of the horror not yet knownIn visit, Biden will thank Polish leader for refugee efforts— Russia demands Mariupol lay down arms but Ukraine says no — ‘No city anymore’:  Mariupol survivors take train to safety— Biden warns US companies of potential Russian cyberattacksGo to https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine for more coverage___OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian army said it forced Russian troops out of Makariv, a strategically important Kyiv suburb, after a fierce battle.
