TOKYO — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to virtually deliver his address to the Japanese parliament on Wednesday to rally international support for his country’s fight against Russian invasion.Japan, unlike in the past, has been acting tough against Russia, in line with other Group of Seven countries, though Tokyo’s steps have triggered Moscow’s retaliation. A compromise could set a bad precedence in East Asia, where China is increasingly making assertive military actions.Zelenskyy’s speech, expected to be about 10 minutes, will be shown in a meeting room at the lower house — the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber parliament which Prime Minister Fumio Kishida belongs to. Zelenskyy has made virtual addresses to the U.S. Congress, as well as parliaments in Europe, Canada, and Israel.ADVERTISEMENTForeign dignitaries, including former U.S. President George W. Bush and former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, have delivered their addresses in person during visits to Japan as state guests, but an online speech by a foreign leader is unprecedented.Russia-Ukraine warLive updates: Zelenskyy to address Japanese parliamentUkraine retakes key Kyiv suburb; battle for Mariupol ragesRussia-Ukraine war: Key things to know about the conflictUkrainian refugees speak of bombs, half-empty cities, hungerOn Monday, Russia announced a decision to discontinue peace treaty talks with Japan over the disputed Kuril islands and withdraw from joint economic projects there, citing Tokyo’s sanctions against Russian invasion of Ukraine.___KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR:— AP video journalist gives riveting first-hand account  of the siege of Mariupol — Russia demands Mariupol lay down arms but Ukraine says no — ‘No city anymore’:  Mariupol survivors take train to safety— Biden warns US companies of potential Russian cyberattacksGo to https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine for more coverage___OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:TOKYO — Japan denounced Russia on Tuesday over its decision to discontinue peace treaty talks over the disputed Kuril islands and withdraw from joint economic projects in retaliation for Tokyo’s sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The two countries never signed a peace treaty formally ending World War II hostilities because of their dispute over the Russian-held islands north of Hokkaido, which Moscow took at the end of the war.ADVERTISEMENT“The latest situation has been all caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters Tuesday.

Unless he meets with Putin, it is impossible to understand whether Russia even wants to stop the war, Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy said that Kyiv will be ready to discuss the status of Crimea and the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists after a cease-fire and steps toward providing security guarantees.___LVIV, Ukraine — Russian forces shelled along a humanitarian corridor on Monday, wounding four children who were among the civilians being evacuated, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation.
