ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) — Turkmenistan established a political dynasty Tuesday, as authorities said the son of the Central Asian country’s leader won its presidential election after an unusual vote-counting delay.Serdar Berdymukhamedov, 40, was the overwhelming favorite in Saturday’s election to lead the isolated, gas-rich country and succeed his father, Gurbanguly. The central election commission said Serdar Berdymukhamedov won 72.97% of the votes.His nearest rival in a field of nine candidates was university official Khyrdyr Nunnayev, who won 11%.There was an unexpected wait for the result, after authorities said Sunday they needed more time to count the votes. Central election commission chairman Gulmyrat Myradov told reporters that votes were still being counted, including those from people living abroad, and that preliminary results would likely be reported Monday.ADVERTISEMENTTurkmenistan typically announces preliminary election results on the following day, such as when the elder Berdymukhamedov won reelection with more than 97% of the vote in 2017. No election in Turkmenistan, which became independent with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, has been considered genuinely competitive.

He had been the country’s leader since he was first appointed acting president when the eccentric Saparmurat Niyazov died in December 2006.The country has long been difficult for outsiders to enter, and has not reported a single case of infection in the coronavirus pandemic. It also has struggled to diversify its economy, overwhelmingly dependent on vast natural gas reserves. The elder Berdymukhamedov established a cult of personality with the title Arkadag, or Protector, and was keen to show his physical fitness with stunts including driving sports cars, target shooting and hoisting a gold weightlifting bar to applause from his cabinet. Under his rule, China replaced Russia as the main buyer for Turkmenistan’s vast gas reserves.Serdar Berdymukhamedov has risen through a series of increasingly prominent government posts and most recently has served as the country’s deputy prime minister, answering directly to his father. He recently turned 40, the minimum age for president according to the Turkmen law.“My main goal is to continue on the glorious path of development built during 30 years of independence and to successfully implement programs aimed at ensuring a high level of social conditions for the people,” Serdar Berdymukhamedov said while presenting his platform in a televised speech.Speaking to reporters after casting his ballot, he vowed to continue the country’s neutral foreign policy if elected.During the campaign, all candidates praised Berdymukhamedov’s father, who said he will retain the post of the head of the country’s upper house of parliament.On voting day, folk dancers and singers performed as loud music blared from loudspeakers at polling stations. Engulfing the stations were fumes from burning harmala, a plant widely used in Turkmenistan to fumigate homes and public spaces to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases.___Angela Charlton in Paris contributed.
