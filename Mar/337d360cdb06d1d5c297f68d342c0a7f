PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) — Young Tampa Bay Rays star Wander Franco has a big new contract and a promising future.What the 21-year-old shortstop doesn’t have is permission to park in a spot reserved for one of his bosses without becoming the subject of a light-hearted spring training prank.When Rays baseball operations president Erik Neander arrived for work at Charlotte Sports Park on Friday, he found his parking space occupied by a Range Rover driven by Franco, who signed a $182 million deal after helping Tampa Bay reach the playoffs as a rookie last season.Players were stretching on the main field at the club’s spring training base, preparing for batting practice when Franco’s vehicle slowly rolled to a resting spot in the outfield — without the surprised Franco behind the wheel.Manager Kevin Cash, who was in on planning the fun, joked that the Ranger Rover was going to be used for target practice.A smiling Franco apologized, then exchanged a hug with Neander. His car was moved back to the parking lot — into a space set aside for team owner Stuart Sternberg.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
