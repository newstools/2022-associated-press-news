LEEDS, England (AP) — Aston Villa handed Leeds a sixth straight Premier League loss as Steven Gerrard’s impressive side won 3-0 Thursday at Elland Road.Philippe Coutinho’s deflected effort gave Villa a halftime lead and the visitors added further second-half goals through Matty Cash and Calum Chambers.It was Villa’s third straight Premier League win, while American coach Jesse Marsch had a rough first home game in charge .It’s the first time since February 2004 that Leeds has lost six consecutive league games, and that year ended with relegation from the Premier League. This was their seventh defeat in their last eight matches and has left them two points above the relegation zone.Marsch replaced Marcelo Bielsa at the beginning of last week and there had been encouraging signs in his first game in charge -- a 1-0 defeat at Leicester -- that the American had shored up a leaky defence.ADVERTISEMENTBut this Leeds display bore all the hallmarks of a side that has lost its way.Raphinha went agonisingly close to giving Leeds an 18th-minute lead after charging down Lucas Digne’s attempted clearance and combining with Dan James, but the Brazilian’s back-heeled effort rolled inches wide.SportsMLB players vote to end lockout, salvaging 162-game seasonEXPLAINER: MLB's lockout is over, so what now?Frenzy Part II?
