ST. LOUIS (AP) — A south St. Louis County man who sued Ford Motor Co. over his exposure to asbestos has been awarded $20 million.In his lawsuit, William Trokey, 76, alleged that his exposure to asbestos while working on Ford brakes as a gas station mechanic in the 1960s led to him being diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer.After a two-week trial, a St. Louis jury on Thursday ordered Ford to pay $10 million to Trokey and $10 million in punitive damages to his wife, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.Under Missouri law, $5 million of the punitive damages goes to the state Tort Victims’ Compensation Fund.A Ford spokesperson said “Our sympathy goes out to the Trokey family and while we respect the jury’s decision, we plan to appeal.”
