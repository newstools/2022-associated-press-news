SAN SIMEON, Calif. (AP) — California’s famous Hearst Castle  will reopen to the public in May after a two-year closure due to the pandemic and severe rainstorm damage that prompted a $13.7 million renovation.The steep, curvy access road to the palatial home that media mogul William Randolph Hearst built on ranch land overlooking the Pacific was damaged by atmospheric rivers — storms fueled by long and wide plumes of moistures pulled in from the Pacific — in 2021.The San Luis Obispo County castle designed by architect Julia Morgan includes a 115-room main house, as well as guesthouses, pools and cultivated gardens, according to the California State Parks. Construction dates back to 1919.The access road, which rises 1,650 feet (503 meters) over 5 miles (8 kilometers), was “reconstructed and re-engineered” over 10 months, according to state officials. The project included replacing and enlarging clay pipe culverts from the 1920s that had been damaged by the rainstorms. Some historic stone retaining walls were also restored by hand.StormsPrivate nonprofits affected by storms near deadline for aidCalifornia's Hearst Castle to reopen after pandemic, damageOfficials: Tornado was New Orleans area's 2nd strongestLouisiana twister carved destruction in mere momentsADVERTISEMENTThe castle sees about 850,000 visitors annually, meaning about 22,000 bus trips traverse the access road each year.
