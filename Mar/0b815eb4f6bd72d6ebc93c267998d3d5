HONOLULU (AP) — The University of Hawaii updated its COVID-19 guidelines to continue requiring face coverings in some indoor settings, even after the state lifts its mask mandate.Starting March 26, which is when Hawaii’s indoor mask mandate goes away, the public university system will continue requiring face masks in classrooms, shared laboratories and other tightly confined educational spaces such as advising offices. Face masks must also be worn by anyone who tests positive for COVID-19, has symptoms or has been exposed to someone with the virus, for the duration of the isolation or quarantine period.Students and employees with a medical or religious exemption from the university’s vaccination requirement must still submit proof of negative tests regularly.The university said Thursday the guidelines will remain at least through the spring semester.As of March 26, the university is no longer requiring daily health screenings via a health app.ADVERTISEMENTFace masks won’t be required in some situations including common areas such as bathrooms and lobbies, eateries, libraries and bookstores. Masks also won’t be required at indoor events such as commencement, sporting events and campus tours. However, event organizers may request masks under certain crowded conditions.Instructors maintaining 6-feeet (2-meters) of distance from others don’t need to wear masks while teaching.
