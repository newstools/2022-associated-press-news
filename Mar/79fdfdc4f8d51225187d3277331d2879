ABINGDON, Va. (AP) — A Virginia man who hid his ownership interest in a waste management company and didn’t report his employment and income from that business on a bankruptcy filing has pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud.The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia said in a news release that David Bryan Stanley, 48, of Clintwood pleaded guilty on Wednesday. According to court documents, Stanley filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2020 with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Virginia. At the time of his filing, Stanley testified under oath that he was unemployed and had no income. However, prosecutors said Stanley knew he had an ownership interest in and received income from a roll-off waste container business he established in 2016. Stanley faces a maximum of five years in prison at sentencing in June.
