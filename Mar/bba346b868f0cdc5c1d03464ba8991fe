WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Tries to winger Sevu Reece and center Leicester Fainga’anuku within five minutes in the second half allowed the Christchurch-based Crusaders to increase a tenuous three-point lead into a 34-19 win over the Hamilton-based Chiefs on Saturday in Super Rugby Pacific.The Crusaders led 15-12 at halftime and that score remained until the 58th minute when Reece was given space down the right flank and took advantage of a two-on-one mismatch on attack to score a brilliant solo try.Fainga’anuku crashed over under the posts in the 63rd minute after the Crusaders forwards had battered away at the Chiefs’ grim goal line defense until it finally buckled. That gave the Crusaders a 29-12 lead and after a late exchange of tries in a high-paced and bruising match they were able to hold on and avenge their last-minute loss to the Chiefs in the first meeting between the teams two weeks ago.ADVERTISEMENT“All week we talked about effort,” Crusaders captain Scott Barrett said. “Last time they hurt us at home. They put in a performance for 80 minutes and we knew coming up here it’s a tough place to play, a tough place to come out on top so we needed a big effort.RugbySuper Rugby Pacific: New Zealand sides Blues, Crusaders winMoana Pasifika beat Hurricanes for 1st Super Rugby winBrumbies seek accuracy, Force seek confidence in Super Rugby2 with extreme-right links arrested in rugby player slaying“Last time the Chiefs probably had the better of possession and territory and they dominated the physical area so we had to turn up physically and I thought the boys showed a lot of heart in that area.The Crusaders started well with a try after only eight minutes to Cullen Grace. Fullback Will Jordan outflanked the Chiefs’ defense to score another in the 18th minute but two tries to center Alex Nankivell kept the Chiefs close at 15-12.The Crusaders’ back-to-back tries midway through the second half took the game away from the Chiefs but Nankivell provided an assist in a late try to Cortez-Lee Ratima. Hooker Codie Taylor scored the Crusaders’ fifth try five minutes from fulltime. The Queensland Reds overcame simultaneous red and yellow cards to beat the New South Wales Waratahs 32-20. The Reds’ win came despite prop Dane Zander’s 31st-minute red card for a high tackle and captain Tate McDermott’s yellow soon after for a deliberate knockdown.The improved Waratahs, missing a host of top-line talent and coach Darren Coleman due to injuries and COVID-19, defended strongly but couldn’t capitalize on their 10-minute, two-man advantage against the Reds.Earlier, the Auckland-based Blues led 18-6 at halftime, then held on grimly to beat the Dunedin-based Highlanders 32-25.The Blues were dominant in a first half in which their defense mostly shut down the Highlanders. Flyhalf Beauden Barrett kicked well to give them territorial superiority and they built a substantial lead with tries to Barrett and winger Caleb Clarke.Roared on by the largest crowd of the season amid relaxed COVID-19 regulations — a sellout of 43,000 in Dunedin — the Highlanders rallied strongly in the second half.ADVERTISEMENTThey cut the lead to seven points for the first time when fullback Sam Gilbert scored an unconverted try in the 49th minute. The Blues lost Barrett to injury and their game lost some of its fluency as the Highlanders began to hold possession and mount more concerted attacks.But a superb try to Blues and All Blacks backrower Hoskins Sotutu in the 55th minute gave the Blues the cushion of a 14-point lead. Sotutu is known for his blockbusting runs and he produced one of his best Saturday, stepping through two weak tackles, then fending off Highlanders halves Aaron Smith and Mitch Hunt.The Highlanders rallied again with a try to 59th-minute try to prop Daniel Lienert-Brown who ran off a neat pass from Hunt. The conversion again restored a seven-point margin.In a quick turnaround, the Blues will now face Moana Pasifika on Tuesday in a previously postponed match and as part of a testing series of three games in eight days.____More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
