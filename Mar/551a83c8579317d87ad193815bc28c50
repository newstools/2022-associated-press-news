He reached his half-century off 54 deliveries.“I didn’t want to get out defending the ball because there are more chances of getting out that way rather than scoring runs. In my mind the intent had to be positive and that’s what I had decided before going out to bat,” Iyer said.At the other end, Embuldeniya dismissed Ravindra Jadeja (4). Ravichandran Ashwin (13) was caught behind off Dhananjaya de Silva (2-32) as India was reduced to 183-7.Iyer and Ashwin had added 35 runs for the seventh wicket.

Chinnaswamy Stadium as India crossed 250 in 58.3 overs.Iyer had added 37 runs for the last two wickets with Mohammed Shami (5) and Jasprit Bumrah (0 not out) for company. He was last out, eight short of a century, holing out off Praveen Jayawickrama (3-81).“I did not have it (the hundred) in mind, once I reached the 80s. Bumrah was defending the ball really well and I never thought I would have to take singles at the end of every over. It is part and parcel of the game. Today wasn’t my day and I have no regrets,” Iyer said.Batting under lights, Sri Lankan batsmen then found the new pink ball too hot to handle in the final session.Iyer held sharp catches at slip as Bumrah dismissed Kusal Mendis (2) and Lahiru Thirimanne (8).ADVERTISEMENTSri Lanka was down to 14-3 in the sixth over as Shami bowled Dimuth Karunaratne (4).Shami picked up a second wicket, trapping de Silva lbw (10).
