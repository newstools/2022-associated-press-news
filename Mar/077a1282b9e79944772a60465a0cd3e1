LONDON (AP) — It was a tumultuous day off the field but business as usual on it for the club that is swiftly becoming one of the most talked about teams in the soccer world — for all the wrong reasons.Early goals from Trevor Chalobah and Mason Mount set Chelsea on its way to a 3-1 victory at bottom club Norwich in the Premier League on Thursday, just hours after unprecedented British government sanctions against Russian owner Roman Abramovich. Those included restrictions that prohibits the team from selling new tickets or merchandise, or signing new players.It meant Chelsea required a special licence to even be allowed to play, but the tough sanctions — which also halted Abramovich’s planned sale of the club — didn’t prevent the away fans from chanting the oligarch’s name from the first whistle. Chelsea’s players showed no sign of being affected by the turmoil as Chalobah headed in Mount’s corner in the third minute and Mount then then got on the scoresheet himself 11 minutes later as he curled in a pass from Kai Havertz.ADVERTISEMENTChelsea appeared to be cruising to comfortable victory but Norwich managed to reduce the deficit with 21 minutes left as Pierre Lees-Melou’s cross hit the arm of Chalobah and, after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor, referee Martin Atkinson pointed to the spot.Russia-Ukraine warRussia-Ukraine war: Key things to know about the conflict'They were shooting civilians': Ukraine refugees saw abusesRussians keep pressure on Mariupol after hospital attackEXPLAINER: What sanctions mean for Roman Abramovich, ChelseaTeemu Pukki stepped up and sent Edouard Mendy the wrong way to set up a nervy finale for Chelsea in Norfolk.But Chelsea wrapped up the points in injury time when substitute N’Golo Kante dribbled into the area and squared it for Havertz to sidefoot home.Chelsea remained third, 13 points behind Premier League leader Manchester City, but increased its advantage over fifth-place Manchester United to nine points.FIGHT FOR EUROPEWolverhampton kept up its bid for a European spot with a comfortable 4-0 victory over relegation-threatened Watford.Wolves jumped into a 3-0 lead after just 21 minutes thanks to an early strike from Raul Jimenez, an own goal by Cucho Hernandez and a Daniel Podence effort.
