HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Montana cannot enforce a state law that prevents most health care facilities from mandating vaccines while an interim federal rule is in place requiring millions of health care workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19, a federal judge ruled Friday.U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy of Missoula said his preliminary injunction applies only while the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid interim rule is in effect because the federal rule takes precedence over the state law. The rule, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in January, requires COVID-19 vaccinations or religious or medical exemptions on file for staff at Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers. The federal rule, and Molloy’s injunction, only apply to COVID-19 shots and do not apply to health care entities that are not regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.ADVERTISEMENTAfter the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid rule, many of Montana’s larger medical facilities said they would meet its requirements.

It included an exemption for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in case the federal government threatened to pull Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement.The Montana Medical Association and some medical providers and clinics filed a lawsuit in September 2021 arguing that they should be exempt from the new state law, as well.The state law — which applies to all vaccinations — prevents medical providers from complying “with national standards for the care and treatment of patients, including observing and enforcing infectious disease prevention protocols,” the complaint stated.
