(AP) — The Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences plans to open a new state laboratory in southeast Alabama that will conduct testing to help combat opioids and other drugs in the region.The Dothan Eagle reported that funding for the $5.3 million project in the Wiregrass region was included in the state operating budget passed by the Alabama House on Tuesday, A state forensics laboratory located in Dothan closed more than a decade ago, and the agency plans to construct a new one that would make it easter and faster for law enforcement to have tests conducted. Police agencies now have to send evidence to a facility in Montgomery or Auburn for analysis.

The department conducts testing for more than 450 accredited police agencies in the state.The budget also included $6 million for a new crisis intervention center in Dothan that would provide authorities with a place where people with substance abuse issues or mental health issues can be admitted for diagnosis.
