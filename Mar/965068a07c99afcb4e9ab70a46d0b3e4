UNDERHILL, Vt. (AP) — Vermont’s maple tree season has officially kicked off with a ceremonial tree tap by Gov. Rick Scott at the Proctor Maple Research Center, celebrating the center’s 75th anniversary helping the state’s maple industry.Monday’s celebration was a change in location for the annual tree-tapping ceremony, which is typically held at a traditional maple farm, WCAX-TV reported.Due to the low supply from last year’s maple season, Abby van den Berg, the assistant director of the center, said researchers wanted the season’s kickoff to be aided by the center to help ensure “good yields and make high-quality maple syrup.”Van den Berg said the 6,000 trees there will provide about a half-gallon of maple syrup per tap. Last year, trees only provided about one-third of a gallon per tap.Vermont usually produces nearly 2 million gallons of maple syrup, making the state the biggest producer in the U.S.But Scott said producing that much maple syrup will depend on the weather this year.
