NORWICH, England (AP) — Chelsea overcame the chaos of a turbulent day off the pitch to grind out a 3-1 win at Norwich on Thursday and stay in the driving seat for Champions League qualification.The Blues took to the field at Carrow Road hours after learning owner Roman Abramovich had been sanctioned by the UK Government and had his assets frozen.It meant Chelsea required a special licence to even be allowed to play this midweek game, but goals by Trevoh Chalobah, Mason Mount and Kai Havertz still clinched all three points.Teemu Pukki’s 69th-minute penalty had cut the deficit for Norwich and set up a nervy finale before Havertz’s late strike, but it was a welcome result at the end of another dramatic day for the club, which Abramovich had put up for sale last week amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine.After a day in which the Champions League holder saw its club shop forced to close, tickets sales suspended and its very future mired in uncertainty, manager Thomas Tuchel was tasked with keeping the players’ focus firmly on the game and he made four changes from Saturday’s 4-0 win at Burnley.ADVERTISEMENTRomelu Lukaku remained on the bench, with Timo Werner given a starting role, and it took only three minutes for the opener to arrive.SportsMLB players vote to end lockout, salvaging 162-game seasonEXPLAINER: MLB's lockout is over, so what now?Frenzy Part II?

Referee Martin Atkinson was advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitchside monitor and a penalty was awarded.Norwich’s top scorer Pukki stepped up and sent Edouard Mendy the wrong way for his eighth goal of the season.A yellow card for Chalobah further whipped up the home crowd and Tuchel turned to Lukaku and N’Golo Kante in the final exchanges to close out the win.It was Kante who made his mark with an assist for Havertz to wrap up the points with a calm finish.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
