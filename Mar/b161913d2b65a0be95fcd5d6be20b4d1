PHOENIX (AP) — A voter-approved sales tax in Pinal County that is designed to fund transportation projects is invalid because it improperly exempts larger transactions, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The tax voters approved in 2017 adopts an illegal two-tier sales tax structure that isn’t allowed under state law, Justice Kathryn King wrote in the ruling that invalidated the tax. She said the county complied with state law when it adopted the tax voters later approved.The tax exempts sales over $10,000 from the .5% tax, which attorneys for the Goldwater Institute said means that lower-income citizens are taxed more heavily for routine purchases than people who buy new cars or jewelry.“The Arizona Supreme Court has rightly put an end to Pinal County’s illegal tax, and we look forward to the public getting back the money they’ve been unlawfully forced to hand over for years,” Goldwater attorney Timothy Sandefur said in a statement.
