SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Yu Darvish will make his second straight opening day start for the San Diego Padres when they open their season on the road against the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 7.New manager Bob Melvin made the decision to go with the right-hander, who was 8-11 last season with a 4.22 ERA. His late-season fade in 2021 mirrored the rest of the Padres, who spent a lot of money during the offseason, started the season with high hopes but ended with a disappointing 79-83 record, far behind the Giants and Dodgers.The 35-year-old Darvish hopes to return to his 2020 form, when he was 8-3 with a 2.01 ERA and finished second in the NL Cy Young Award voting. He’s had a good start to the spring, striking out 10 batters over seven innings while giving up just one earned run in the Cactus League.The five-time All-Star also started on opening day for the Rangers in 2017.ADVERTISEMENTRULES FOR ’22MLB finalized a rules change to bring back automatic runners in extra innings for a third straight season.Despite an easing of pandemic restrictions, MLB and the players’ association agreed to keep the controversial rule that starts each team with a runner on second base during extra innings for the 2022 regular season.MLBThursday Sports in BriefEx-minor leaguer ran major league sports betting operationDavid Price waiting to see how Dodgers will deploy his armShane Bieber to start Guardians' season opener in KCThe agreement regarding on-field rules modifications also includes expanding active rosters from 26 players to 28 from opening day on April 7 through May 1 this year, due to the delayed start of spring training.Another new rule benefits Angels two-way star Shohei Ohtani.
