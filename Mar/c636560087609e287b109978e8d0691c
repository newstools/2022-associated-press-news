THERMAL, Calif. (AP) — Firefighters in Riverside County said no one was hurt in a blaze that destroyed a group of mobile homes surrounded by agricultural fields near the Salton Sea, displacing 30 people. KESQ-TV reports  that 19 adults and 11 children lost their homes Tuesday. By the time firefighters were able to contain the flames, the fire destroyed five homes and two other structures.One mother of four said she was taking a bath when her husband came home yelling for her to get out. “I quickly went out to put on my clothes to run, to get out, but we couldn’t get anything out,” said Vilma Peralta. Peralta told Telemundo 15 that they lost everything. She said they don’t earn that much working in the fields, so “it’s hard to get things done and do it all over again, but I know that with God’s will we will get back on our feet.”
