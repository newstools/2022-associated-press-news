SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico’s governor signed law four bills into law that will increase funding for education, including major hikes to teacher salaries.Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham held the ceremony Tuesday outdoors at an elementary school in Santa Fe, following the passage of the bills by the Legislature last month.Flanked by school children and the national leader of a teacher’s union, she signed one bill that will increase teacher and counselor salary minimums by $10,000. Currently, teachers make at least $40,000 when they start out, $50,000 after additional training and experience, and $60,000 when they pass an intensive master teacher certification.ADVERTISEMENTStarting teachers and counselors earning a minimum salary would benefit the most, with a 22% raise.Many school workers, from nurses to janitors to those who already earn more than the minimum won’t benefit from that measure. But Lujan Grisham is expected to sign another bill that, after deducting increases in minimum salaries, will ensure all school workers at least 7% more than income than they earn now.On Tuesday, Lujan Grisham also signed bills aimed at supporting teachers in training and luring retirees back to the classroom.___Attanasio is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
