LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Liverpool could cope with its first Anfield loss in a year to still overcome Inter Milan and reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League.Leading 2-0 from the last-16 first leg in Italy, Lautaro Martinez’s swerving shot that reduced the deficit in the 61st minute gave the Italian champions a hope of a comeback.But within two minutes, Inter’s task was made more difficult when Alexis Sanchez was sent off after his follow-through on Fabinho earned him a second booking.Liverpool held on to lose 1-0 and advance 2-1 on aggregate. The 2019 Champions League winners are in the quarterfinals for the fourth time in five years despite its first loss in the competition this season.Liverpool had chances to level. Mohamed Salah volleyed against the post and Luis Diaz’s close-range shot was deflected over by Arturo Vidal.“We struggled in the beginning,” Salah said. “We managed to hold the ball up more in the second half. The most important thing is we qualified. Hopefully we’ll be better in the next game.”ADVERTISEMENTInter went out with only the consolation of being the first team to win at Anfield since Fulham 366 days earlier.SoccerNYCFC beats Comunicaciones 3-1 in Champions League quartersPesticide spraying company found liable for pesticide driftsRowdy fans barred, 14 arrested in Mexico soccer match brawlLiverpool reaches CL quarterfinals despite loss to Inter“The difficulties we had were pretty close to what I expected,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told broadcaster BT Sport. “Inter are a really good side and set up for these kind of games.
