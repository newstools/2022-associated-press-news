A look at action around the Southeastern Conference on the final weekend of the regular season:Auburn (26-4, 14-3 SEC) can clinch the regular season title outright with a win over South Carolina (18-11, 9-8) at Auburn Arena. Three other teams enter Saturday vying for a share of the championship — and the No. 1 SEC Tournament seed — with 13-4 league marks: No. 7 Kentucky (24-6), No. 14 Arkansas (24-6) and No. 13 Tennessee (22-7). All three won their mid-week games. The Tigers control their own fate. If they beat the Gamecocks, who have won five of their last six games, they win their fourth regular season title outright. Auburn won the first meeting 81-66 in Columbia on Jan. 4. The Razorkbacks and Volunteers meet in an early game so only one will still be in contention when the Auburn-South Carolina game ends. If three teams are tied, the first tiebreaker for the top seed in Tampa, Florida, will be the best winning percentage among the deadlocked trio. Arkansas beat both Auburn and Kentucky and could make a clean sweep with a second win over the Vols. Tennessee and Kentucky split their two meetings, while the Vols beat Auburn. The Tigers topped the Wildcats.ADVERTISEMENTSportsMLB, union meet for 1 1/2 hours, discuss next step in talksClippers surge to 132-111 victory, season sweep of LakersDurant has 31 points in return, but Heat rally to beat NetsDoncic scores 41 points, Mavs beat Warriors again, 122-113PLAYER TO WATCHArkansas star JD Notae still made a big impact even when he wasn’t scoring a bunch.
