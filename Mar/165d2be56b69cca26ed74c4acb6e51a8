TORONTO (AP) — The Toronto Maple Leafs will be without No. 1 goaltender Jack Campbell for at least the next two weeks because of a rib injury, head coach Sheldon Keefe said after Thursday’s morning skate.Keefe said the 30-year-old Campbell “tweaked something” a while ago and then aggravated the issue during a 26-save performance in Tuesday night’s 6-4 victory over the Seattle Kraken.“I knew that he was uncomfortable after the game, and (Wednesday) wasn’t feeling a lot better,” Keefe said. “They sent him for some tests and ultimately found out he needs some time.”Campbell had an excellent start to the season to earn his first All-Star nod but has an .865 save percentage since mid-January.Petr Mrazek, who signed a three-year contract in free agency in July, will take over in goal. Mrazek, who had a tough start to his tenure with the Maple Leafs after twice being felled by a groin injury, has a 10-5-0 record this season with an .890 save percentage.ADVERTISEMENTThe Leafs have recalled Erik Kallgren from the AHL’s Toronto Marlies on an emergency basis. The 25-year-old Swede has a 15-8-1 record with a .904 save percentage in his first campaign with the Marlies. He’s expected to serve as Mrazek’s backup Thursday against Arizona.___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
