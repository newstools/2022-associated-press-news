ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia lawmakers waded through dozens of bills at a key deadline. Tuesday was crossover day in the General Assembly, when bills and other measures are required to pass in the House or Senate and move on to the other chamber. Lawmakers rejected legalizing horse racing, while they had yet to vote late Tuesday on changes to voting laws. Some key proposals had moved forward earlier, like a mental health reform measure. Measures that had failed earlier included a proposal to loosen the state’s hands-free cellphone law for drivers. Because of legislative rules, it’s still possible for lawmakers to later resurrect many proposals that don’t pass on Tuesday.—-ADVANCEDVOTING: House Bill 1464 would let people inspect paper ballots after an election, allow only the State Election Board to accept private donations for election administration and let the Georgia Bureau of Investigation examine election fraud claims.ADVERTISEMENTPROTESTS: Senate Bill 171 requires a permit for any assembly, increases criminal penalties for protests, makes it a felony to block a highway or deface a monument, lets people sue local governments if protests turn violent, and makes it legal for someone to run over someone else while fleeing a protest if the person fleeing believed their life was in danger.BusinessEXPLAINER: What would a Russian bond default mean?Embattled Federal Reserve pick Raskin withdraws nominationWar in Ukraine disrupts key supply chains - and livesSudden braking in 2 VW SUV models draws regulatory scrutinyLAWMAKER PAY AND PENSIONS: Pay for Georgia’s 180 House members and 56 senators would rise to 60% of the state median household income, rising to about $36,000, if voters approved under House Resolution 842.
