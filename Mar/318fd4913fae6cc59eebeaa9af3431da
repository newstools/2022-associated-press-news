In a checkered season, disrupted by COVID-19, they had played only two matches in five rounds before Friday’s match gave them their historic first-ever Super Rugby win.ADVERTISEMENT“We had to work hard from last week and we showed pride and passion,” Moana Pasifika captain Sekope Kepu said. “We worked really hard in the pre-season and we knew we had it in us.
