The board condemned “in the strongest possible terms Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine and apparent targeting of civilian populations,” Chair Lyndel Manson said in a statement. “With today’s action, the board repudiates Putin’s aggression and ensures Arizona’s public university enterprise divests of any Russian assets.”The number of Ukrainians that have fled their country since Russia invaded reached 1.7 million on Monday, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency. Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24.
