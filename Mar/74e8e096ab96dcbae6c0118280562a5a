TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gas prices are soaring in New Jersey and around the nation amid a decrease in the domestic gasoline supply and an increase in demand amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.AAA Mid-Atlantic says the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $3.89, an increase of 26 cents in the last week. Analysts say that’s just 10 cents shy of the record high price in the Garden State of $3.99 set on July 8, 2008. Drivers were paying an average of $2.86 a gallon a year ago at this time.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.83, also an increase of 26 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $2.74 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.Analysts say the situation in Ukraine, coupled with tight worldwide oil supplies and increased demand, is sending crude oil and gas prices higher months away from the start of the peak summer driving season. They say speculation can err, but economic indicators point to higher prices “for the remainder of winter and into spring.”
