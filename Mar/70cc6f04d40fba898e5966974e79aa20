KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A federal judge has temporarily lifted a requirement that students wear masks while attending classes in an East Tennessee school district.Judge J. Ronnie Greer agreed on Monday to suspend his order for students in Knox County for up 60 days, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported. The move comes six days after the Knox County Board of Education and four families involved in a lawsuit over masking requirements both requested that the rule be temporarily suspended. Greer has ordered the two sides to mediate.Knox County Schools said masks are no longer required “effective immediately,” though students and staff may still wear one when classes resume on March 21. The district is currently on spring break.Knox County adopted a mask mandate during the 2020-21 school year but chose not to this year despite COVID-19 numbers that remained high when classes began. Greer ordered the school system to adopt a mask mandate in September to help protect children with health problems more susceptible to the coronavirus pandemic. The judge said the mask rule could be reinstated if circumstances change. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently lists Knox County in a “low risk” category for the virus and recommends personal preference with masking.
