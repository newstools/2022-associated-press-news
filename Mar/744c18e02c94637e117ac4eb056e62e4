Shane Dezonie had 10 points with a pair of 3s. The Commodores used a 19-5 run, capped by Pippen’s 3, for a 23-9 lead on their way to a 35-14 halftime advantage. Back-to-back 3s from Stute and Wright stretched the lead to 31 points early in the second half.ADVERTISEMENTBraelen Bridges scored 15 points and Kario Oquendo had 11 for Georgia (6-26).
