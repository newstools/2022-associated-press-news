SEATTLE (AP) — A state advisory group has decided against recommending a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for students in K-12 schools.The state Board of Health last fall created a separate technical advisory group tasked with researching whether a COVID vaccine would meet all the scientific criteria needed to be added to the list of required K-12 immunizations. The volunteer group was made up of doctors, public health officers, state and local education leaders and community organizers.The group has met several times and in a vote late last month, six were in favor of a COVID vaccine requirement in schools, seven were against and four were unsure, The Seattle Times reported. That means the group will recommend against adding the COVID vaccine to the state’s administrative code when it presents its findings to the board.ADVERTISEMENT“We need to keep our eye on the long term of what we’re trying to accomplish, and I think that’s community health overall,” Greg Lynch, a member of the advisory group and superintendent of the Olympic Educational Service District 114, said during the Feb. 24 meeting. “We can’t afford right now to create a movement where the call is ‘Go fast now,’ without having a complete picture (of long-term data), which I worry about.”Coronavirus pandemicAs adjournment nears, WA lawmakers reach budget agreementsRepublican Iowa Gov.
