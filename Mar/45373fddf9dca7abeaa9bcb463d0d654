BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — More hunting licenses for elk will be offered by North Dakota’s Game and Fish Department this year, but there will be fewer moose licenses. A bighorn sheep hunting season could also take place, depending on the pending results of summer sheep population surveys. The status of that season will be determined Sept. 1, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The state is making 563 elk licenses available for the fall hunt, an increase of 40 from last year. There are 404 moose licenses available, a decrease of 70. Because of a reduced number of moose, a couple of units, M4 and M1C will remain closed in northeastern North Dakota. Bighorn applicants must apply for a license at the same time as moose and elk, but not for a specific unit. Once total licenses are determined for each unit in late summer, the bighorn lottery will be held and successful applicants contacted to select a hunting unit. ADVERTISEMENTThose who are not selected will not receive a hunting fee refund. Successful applicants will not receive a refund if a season isn’t held.The deadline to apply for elk, moose and bighorn sheep licenses is March 23. The licenses are once-in-a-lifetime in North Dakota, so hunters who have received a license in the past are not eligible to apply for that species again.Hunter success during the 2021 season was 65% for elk, 80% for bighorn sheep and 90% for moose, according to Game and Fish statistics.
