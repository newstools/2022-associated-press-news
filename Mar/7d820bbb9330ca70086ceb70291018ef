NEW IBERIA, La. (AP) — Reading takes the spotlight this weekend when The Books Along the Teche Literary Festival returns for its sixth annual run. The event kicks off Friday and continue through Sunday afternoon, predominantly in New Iberia’s historic district. While most of the festival is free, some events do require a ticket,  KATC-TV reported.  There is an option for an all-inclusive ticket at a discounted rate, or you can purchase separate tickets for each event, organizers said.There will be something for everyone attending the  festival, young and old.“We really upped our game on the children’s section of the festival,” co-coordinator Ellen Mullen said. “So in Rodrigue Park on Main Street, we have lots of children’s authors. We’re going to have face painting, storytime, lots of activities for the kids. At noon we’re going to have an award ceremony for the child that wrote the best poem and named our mascot.”More than 40 authors will line Main Street on Saturday with their books to chat with readers. Organizers said they’ve spoken to people planning to come from as far as Sweden to participate in the planned festivities.
