Scott Wahl said.“We believe that his daughter was up on the rooftop with him, and was able to view what happened,” Wahl said.According to police radio traffic, a 911 caller heard a “loud pop” similar to a gunshot, looked over a balcony and saw the man bleeding on the ground, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENTOfficers and paramedics gave the man CPR, but he died before he could be taken to a hospital, officials said. He wasn’t immediately identified.
