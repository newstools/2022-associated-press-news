MORGAN CITY, La. (AP) — A Louisiana shipyard has a $19 million Navy contract with the potential to build nearly $143 million worth of barges that can house crews while their ships are being repaired. Barracks barges sometimes also house civilians during emergencies.The Naval Sea Systems Command can order up to eight of the barges, which will be built to house 199 people, Conrad Shipyard LLC of Morgan City said in a news release. A Pentagon list of contracts signed March 15 says Conrad was among six bidders. The vessels will be built in Amelia. In Navy terms, they’ll be “yard repair, berthing, and messing” craft. Conrad said its barge will have rooms for medical offices, classrooms, workspaces, laundry rooms, storerooms, and lounge areas. and will be able to provide food service — or “messing” — for 300 people. They’ll be 14 feet (4.3 meters) wide and more than 151 feet (46 meters) long.ADVERTISEMENTHalter Marine is building larger Navy barges, called auxiliary personnel lighters, at its shipyard in Pascagoula. Those barracks barges can house about 600 people — 74 officers and 537 enlisted personnel. They can provide three meals a day to more than 1,100 people in 20-minute shifts of about 250.
