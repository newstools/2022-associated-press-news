NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Liberty were fined a WNBA record $500,000 for chartering flights to away games during the second half of the season last year and for other league rules violations, according to a person familiar with the fine.The person spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press on Wednesday because no official announcement of the fine had been made.Liberty owners Joe and Clara Tsai, who have been very vocal about trying to find better travel accommodations for WNBA teams, paid for the charters as well as for a trip to Napa Valley over Labor Day weekend. That trip was a benefit that vastly exceeded the allowable compensation to players.The league typically doesn’t allow teams to charter because it could create a competitive advantage for teams who can afford to pay for them. Sports Illustrated was the first to report the story. The fine was levied last fall.
