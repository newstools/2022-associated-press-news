That reassured investors worried he might back more aggressive moves to fight inflation.But Powell warned Thursday that the fighting in Ukraine is likely to further magnify the high inflation troubling world economies. He said he is committed to doing whatever is necessary to slow inflation, underscoring the high-risk challenge in raising interest rates enough to cool price pressures without triggering another recession. Russia is a key oil producer and prices have been rising as global supplies are threatened by the conflict, raising concerns that persistent inflation could become even hotter.ADVERTISEMENTPowell said inflation is thought to rise about 0.2 percentage point for each $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil. Oil prices have surged by $40 a barrel since early December to about $110, suggesting price pressures will be higher than they otherwise would have been in coming months. Early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude was $2.15 to $109.82 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost $2.93 to $107.67 per barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, the international price standard, added $1.77 to $112.23. Trading on the Moscow exchange remained closed Thursday. Russia’s ruble lost another 15% against the U.S. dollar and is worth less than 1 cent. It has plunged since Western governments imposed sanctions that cut off much of Russia’s access to the global financial system.The exposure and overlap that U.S. markets have to Russia is relatively low. The real risk is the exposure that European banks have to Russia, said Liz Young, chief investment strategist at SoFi. “If European banks start to feel the contagion of that, then it’s about what’s our exposure to Europe, which surprisingly is still reasonably low,” she said. “That doesn’t mean there’s not sentiment risk. Nobody likes to hear about financial markets freezing up.”Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is dominating as investors try to assess its global impact. “For a world that was already grappling with worryingly high (cost-push) inflation before Ukraine’s invasion, the surge in commodity prices from the geo-political spill-over is not merely an inconvenience, but rather a binding economic threat,” Mizuho Bank said in a commentary.
