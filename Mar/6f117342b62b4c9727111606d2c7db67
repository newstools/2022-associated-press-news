IRVINE, Ky. (AP) — A Kentucky River bridge in Irvine will be closed for four months so that it can be repaired and repainted, officials said.The span in Estill County, which carries Kentucky 52 and Kentucky 89 over the river, will be closed from March 16 through mid-July, a statement from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. The bridge also was closed from December through February for expansion joint repair, but some of that work had to be delayed due to inclement weather, the statement said. During the upcoming closure, the bridge will also get a new coat of paint, a deck overlay and metal railing repairs.A signed detour will be in place during the closure of the bridge, which was built in 1940 and carries about 12,000 vehicles daily.
