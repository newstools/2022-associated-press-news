COPENHAGEN (AP) — Christian Eriksen is set to train with the Denmark squad on Thursday and could make his return to the national team in Saturday’s friendly match against the Netherlands, Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand said.It would be Eriksen’s first appearance for Denmark since he collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during a European Championship game in June.He has resumed his playing career in the past few weeks at Premier League club Brentford but missed the match against Leicester on Sunday after contracting COVID-19.Eriksen will join up with the Danish national team late Wednesday, Danish broadcaster DR said, and will be ready to train ahead of the match at the Johan Cruyff Arena — where he used to play for Dutch club Ajax.“We just have to look at what exactly he has done at Brentford, where he started training again on Sunday,” Hjulmand said Wednesday. “Before that, he had missed the workouts for four days. We have to see how much he has done when we get the latest data.”ADVERTISEMENTHjulmand said the most likely scenario is that Eriksen, who has been fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, will start on the bench against the Netherlands. Denmark then plays Serbia in a friendly at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen on Tuesday.“He is 100% ready to play at Parken,” Hjulmand said.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
