BANGKOK (AP) — Ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi did not attend recent court hearings in which she is a defendant because she has been quarantined due to possible exposure to the coronavirus, a legal official said Monday.Suu Kyi is being tried in the capital, Naypyitaw, in several cases involving charges of corruption, election fraud and violating a state secrets law.She has been detained since Feb. 1 last year when the army seized power and prevented her and her party from starting a second five-year term in office after a landslide victory in a 2020 general election.The legal official, who is familiar with the cases involving Suu Kyi, said the 76-year-old deposed leader missed a hearing on Monday in a case involving corruption charges because she was quarantined after some of the people helping with her care were found to be infected with the coronavirus.ADVERTISEMENTSuu Kyi, who has been vaccinated, has not tested positive, he said.She is being held at an undisclosed location in Naypyitaw where she has stayed following convictions on lesser charges for which she has been sentenced to six years’ imprisonment.Coronavirus pandemicAt a pugnacious Oscars, Apple's feel-good 'CODA' triumphsMyanmar's Suu Kyi misses court hearings due to quarantineFauci named keynote speaker at Roger Williams U commencementConvoy protesting COVID mandates to rolls on to CaliforniaThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from the military government, which seeks to keep the proceedings secret.
