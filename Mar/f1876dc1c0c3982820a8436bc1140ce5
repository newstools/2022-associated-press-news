BOSTON (AP) — Kim Janey, the former Boston acting mayor and city councilor, has landed a new gig, a one-year assignment leading an effort by the philanthropic Boston Foundation to identify and preserve important historical landmarks in neighborhoods populated predominantly by people of color.As the foundation’s executive in residence, Janey will work closely with foundation President M. Lee Pelton and other staff with a particular emphasis on landmarks that have disappeared or are at risk of disappearing, the foundation said in a statement Wednesday.Janey, the first woman and first person of color to serve as Boston’s mayor, took over for about eight months last year when Marty Walsh was named labor secretary in President Joe Biden’s administration. “My own historic moment as the first woman and person of color to serve as Boston mayor would not have been possible without the work of so many others who came before me,” Janey said in a statement. “But too much of that work has been rendered invisible through carelessness, indifference, or intentional destruction, and much of the rest is still under threat.”ADVERTISEMENTThe goal of the project is to preserve city history and drive racial equity and justice.Joe BidenEx-acting Mayor Janey to lead effort saving Boston landmarksBiden risks progressives, Blacks with pivot to the centerBiden's past Supreme Court experience helped inform choiceBiden, other Quad leaders to meet virtually amid Ukraine war“We cannot truly repair the systemic inequities in our city and build a new Boston without more fully cataloging the landmarks that have served as centers of community and place, particularly in our Black, Asian and Latino neighborhoods, over the course of Boston’s history,” Pelton said.Janey is also serving in two academic posts at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and at Salem State University.The project will proceed alongside an effort to put up a sculpture in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King on the Boston Common.The Boston Foundation, founded in 1915, is one of the largest community foundations in the nation with net assets of $1.3 billion that last year made $174 million in grants to nonprofit organizations.
