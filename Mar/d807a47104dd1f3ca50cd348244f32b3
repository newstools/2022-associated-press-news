NEW YORK (AP) — Television ratings for the Oscars  rebounded somewhat from last year’s record low, but the event clearly doesn’t have the appeal to viewers that it once had.Sunday’s ceremony reached an estimated 15.36 million viewers, according to preliminary Nielsen company numbers released on Monday by ABC. A more detailed estimate is expected Tuesday, with elements like out-of-home viewing added.“CODA” won best picture in Sunday’s ceremony, but all of the winners and losers were overshadowed by best actor winner Will Smith storming the stage to slap comic Chris Rock because of a joke Rock made about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.ADVERTISEMENTHeld in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 ceremony had reached a startlingly low 9.85 million viewers. That led to several changes in the Oscars going into this year, including the addition of hosts and awarding eight categories ahead of the broadcast and editing them into the live show.Chris RockWill Smith apologizes: 'I was out of line and I was wrong'Comedians react with horror at Will Smith's Oscar slap Pinkett Smith's hair loss from alopecia at center of spatSmith slap another stunning live moment in TV entertainmentWhile that clearly seemed to help, an audience of 15 million is still below the 23.6 million people who watched the Oscars in 2020. Until last year, that was the smallest-ever audience for an Oscars ceremony.Nielsen did not immediately have more specific viewership numbers for Sunday’s show. The research company Samba TV said its own statistics indicate some 1.5 million more households watched the Oscars after the Smith-Rock incident than were watching before.Viewership for live television events, with the notable exception of NFL football games, has been declining for several years with the advent of streaming and cord-cutting. Some Hollywood observers believe that the relatively niche appeal of many films honored by the Oscars has also limited the audience.
