WACO, Texas (AP) — Former Baylor basketball player Tweety Carter has been named the team’s director of player development, a position that opened when Bears head coach Scott Drew made other adjustments to his staff following the departure of Jerome Tang to become Kansas State’s head coach. Jared Nuness was promoted to on-court assistant coach, the school announced Tuesday. Nuness has been at Baylor for 12 years, the past five as director of player development. Carter played professionally for 12 years, most recently in the Polish Basketball League. He also played in the G-League, and overseas in Israel, Latvia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Lithuania, Greece and Portugal.“It’s always great when we can bring aboard one of our own, and Tweety was a huge part of laying the foundation for this program,” Drew said. Carter was the first McDonalds All-American in program history and started 89 of his 131 games at Baylor from 2006-10. He averaged 15 points and a Big 12-leading 5.9 assists per game as a senior, when the Bears made it to the NCAA Elite Eight in 2010.
