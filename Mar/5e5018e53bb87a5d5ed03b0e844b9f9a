LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nevada’s National Guard is wrapping up its largest, longest state activation in response to a domestic emergency as Nevada surpassed 10,000 deaths from COVID-19 since the state’s first case was confirmed two years ago.The Nevada National Guard will close its mission in support of the state’s coronavirus response on April 1, exactly two years after it began, 1st Lt. Emerson Marcus said Thursday.More than 1,400 Nevada Guardsmen and women contributed to the effort, with a peak of 1,139 members on orders to assist in April 2020. The state activation lasted more than 700 days, the longest for any activation for any reason in state history, Marcus said.State health officials this week reported 82 more deaths since last week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, bringing the overall total to 10,031.The state Department of Health and Human Services  began this month to report COVID-19 data weekly, instead of daily. It said it no longer reports test positivity because the rate is increasingly skewed by widespread use of home-testing that goes unreported.Coronavirus pandemicContagious omicron subvariant in OregonHawaii governor extends COVID-19 food assistance spendingNYC lifts vaccine rule that blocked athletes from home gamesPritzker debt-reduction approved as watchdog praises planADVERTISEMENTThe Nevada Hospital Association reported Wednesday that hospitalizations continue to decline, but “staffing remains a significant concern, contributing to hospitals’ continued difficulty transferring patients out to lower, more appropriate levels of care.”Clark County, including Las Vegas, reported 622 new cases and 46 deaths this week, bringing totals posted by the Southern Nevada Health District  to more than 495,000 cases and 7,739 deaths.
