MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department is holding public hearings this month on next fall’s proposed moose hunt in the northeastern part of the state and the health status of the deer herd. The results of last year’s deer hunting seasons and the prospects for next fall will be discussed, the department said. It’s also a chance for people to share their observations and opinions about the status of the deer herd, officials said.The department has proposed issuing 100 moose hunting permits next fall for the northeastern corner of the state to reduce the effects of winter ticks on the animal’s population. Three in-person hearings will be held at 6:30 p.m. on March 21 at Spaulding High School, March 23 at Kehoe Conservation Camp in Castleton, and March 24 at Lake Region High School in Orleans. An online meeting  takes place on March 29.More information can be found on the Fish and Wildlife Department’s website.
