BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts is poised to begin distributing $500 payments to about 500,000 low-income workers, Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday.The payments are part of a COVID-19 program for essential employees that was included in a $4 billion spending plan approved by lawmakers and signed by Baker in December using federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars.The payments, worth a total of $250 million, will be mailed out by the end of March, officials said.“This program will support those workers who served our communities, especially early in the pandemic,” Baker said in a written statement.Based on 2020 Massachusetts tax returns, individuals will be eligible for payments if their income from employment was at least $12,750 and their total income put them below 300% of the federal poverty level.A single filer with no dependents who earned up to $38,280 would be eligible for the payments while a resident who files with a spouse and two dependents, or with no spouse and three dependents, could be eligible with a household income up to $78,600.Married filers can each be eligible, provided each independently qualifies.Individuals who received unemployment compensation in 2020 will not be eligible for the first round of payments.
