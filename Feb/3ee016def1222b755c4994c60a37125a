LONDON (AP) — The European Broadcasting Union says that Russia will not be allowed an entry in this year’s Eurovision Song Contest because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine.The union said in a statement Friday that including a Russian entry this year would bring the competition into “disrepute.″Russian troops bore down on Ukraine’s capital Friday with shelling hitting a Kyiv apartment building and pummeling bridges and schools. Hundreds of casualties have been reported since Russia began its assault Thursday.
