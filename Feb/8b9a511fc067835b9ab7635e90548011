SYDNEY (AP) — Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka won the toss and decided to send Australia in to bat Friday in the first of five Twenty20 matches.Aaron Finch leads the Australians for the first time since their T20 World Cup win last November and the exit of head coach Justin Langer last week.Finch said he would have made the same call if he had won the toss at the Sydney Cricket Ground.“We would’ve bowled first but we’re not too fussed,” Finch said. “The wicket has been used before throughout the summer so hopefully we can post a score and defend it later on.”Australia made two changes, with Ben McDermott opening the batting alongside Finch. England-born Josh Inglis debuts at No. 3 and Matthew Wade retains the wicketkeeping duties.Sri Lanka has not beaten Australia in T20 cricket since 2017.__Lineups:Australia:: Ben McDermott, Aaron Finch (captain), Josh Inglis, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood.ADVERTISEMENTSri Lanka: Danushka Gunathilaka, Pathum Nissanka, Charith Asalanka, Avishka Fernando, Dinesh Chandimal, Dasun Shanaka (captain), Chamika Karunaratne, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Binura Fernando.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
