MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Vermonters who raise turkeys or chickens are asked to be on alert for a highly pathogenic avian influenza after it was detected in some domestic flocks and wild birds in other states. The virus has been detected at two commercial turkey farms in southern Indiana, a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Kentucky and a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia. In 2015, a widespread bird flu outbreak killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.The virus is often spread to domestic poultry by infected wild birds. U.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina.ADVERTISEMENTThe Vermont Agency of Agriculture say anyone involved with poultry production should review their biosecurity activities to ensure the health of their birds, restrict human movement onto the farm and limit contact with poultry to only those who need to be there.
