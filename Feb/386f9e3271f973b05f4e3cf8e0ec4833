PRIOR LAKE, Minn. (AP) — A high school girls’ basketball team in a city near Minneapolis will forfeit its final game and first-round playoff match after a player found a racist note in her gym bag, school officials have informed parents. The team’s coach, Demondi Johnson, at Prior Lake High School has also announced his resignation. Johnson said he hoped whoever left the racist note “can be educated, be held accountable, heal their hearts of hatred, and learn to love those who look different from them.”Late last year, Prior Lake generated widespread attention when video of two high school students berating a Black classmate with a racist slur went viral, leading to protests on campus and in downtown Minneapolis, the Star Tribune reported. ADVERTISEMENTThe decision to end the girls’ basketball season comes the same week that St. Louis Park and Robbinsdale school districts announced they’ll no longer play against New Prague High after that school’s athletes and fans reportedly made racial taunts toward boys’ hockey and girls’ basketball players during separate games on Feb. 15.After the New Prague incidents, the Minnesota State High School League announced a partnership with several other organizations to “identify and provide resources to assist schools” in addressing racist incidents during sporting events.
