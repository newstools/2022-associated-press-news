CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A family has made a $1 million gift to establish a scholarship fund for students enrolled at any of New Hampshire’s seven community colleges. The gift from Anna Grace and Paul Holloway is the largest private donation in the history of the community college system in the state, its foundation said in a news release last week. The Holloway Family Scholarship Fund will support students with financial need and help provide them an entry point into higher education and enhanced opportunities. “Our goal in making this gift is to inspire and support men and women across New Hampshire seeking affordable, flexible education and connecting them to local careers. We recognized that working through the Foundation was the best way we could accomplish this,” Paul Holloway said in a statement. “It’s not about us; it’s about the students and the future of New Hampshire.” Holloway, an entrepreneur who began his career in the automotive industry, has served on the community college system’s Board of Trustees for over two decades,
