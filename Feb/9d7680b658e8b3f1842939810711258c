BERLIN (AP) — A fired-up Robert Lewandowski scored twice as Bayern Munich came from behind to beat last-place Greuther Fürth 4-1 in the Bundesliga on Sunday.The Poland star took his league-leading tally to 28 goals in 23 games and helped Bayern stretch its lead to nine points before second-place Borussia Dortmund hosted Borussia Mönchengladbach later.If Bayern fans had been expecting a reaction after two games without a win — Bayern lost 4-2 at promoted Bochum before drawing 1-1 in Salzburg in the Champions League — they had to wait till the second half to get it.Fürth captain Branimir Hrgota fired the competitive underdogs ahead in the 42nd minute when his free kick took a decisive deflection off Bayern’s Marcel Sabitzer.Riled by the setback, Lewandowski was booked for his reaction to Hrgota after the Pole fouled the forward to stop a counterattack.There were even whistles from some unhappy Bayern supporters at the break.ADVERTISEMENTBayern coach Julian Nagelsmann’s halftime talk had quick results.Lewandowski equalized only a minute into the second half and Bayern kept pushing to force an own-goal from Sebastian Griesbeck in the 61st.
