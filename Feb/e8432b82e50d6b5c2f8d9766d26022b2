PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — The State Bar of South Dakota is asking the Legislature to make permanent an emergency order that allows certain legal documents to be witnessed remotely. The Supreme Court made the emergency order nearly two years ago in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Andrew Fergle, executive director of the State Bar, says COVID-19 has closed doors to lawyers needing to meet with clients in facilities and has made it difficult to get in-person witnesses for clients’ signatures.Fergle told the Senate Judiciary Committee recently that the problem goes beyond the pandemic for older attorneys who routinely face the same difficulties, South Dakota Public Broadcasting  reported. “Restrictions to clients in nursing homes, assisted living, or other care facilities has been an issue for years in order to protect vulnerable populations from the flu and other communicable diseases,” Fergle said.ADVERTISEMENTTo address that, the state bar’s Elder Law Committee proposed a solution and the result is Senate Bill 107.

She also testified before the Senate committee. “We encounter these issues all the time,” she told the committee. “Almost every year long-term care facilities will close down their doors to visitors or outsiders during the flu season.”
