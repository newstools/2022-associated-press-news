PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The Rhode Island National Guard has canceled its air show for the fourth year in a row.The Guard announced the decision on Friday, attributing it to a number of “operational challenges” including ongoing deployments and the Guard’s responsibilities in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Other reasons cited were ongoing runway work at the Quonset State Airport, and a reduction in nearby parking.The event was cancelled in 2021 and 2020 because of the pandemic. The 2019 show was called off because of ongoing deployments. This year’s Ocean State Air Show had been scheduled for June. “We will continue to work together to explore the possibility of holding the Ocean State Air Show in 2023,” the Guard said in a statement.
