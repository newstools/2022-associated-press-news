Connect 313 was developed through the Rocket Mortgage Classic, the city of Detroit, Microsoft and the United Way for Southeastern Michigan.“It is our passion to use the Rocket Giving Fund as a force for change,” said Jay Farner, fund chair and chief executive of Rocket Companies. “The success of ‘Changing the Course’ is measured by the number of Detroit families who are now able to access the internet as well as the brighter future digital inclusion provides.”ADVERTISEMENTIn 2020, roughly 40% of Detroit households had at least one member with reliable broadband connection, a working non-smartphone computer or tablet and the knowledge of how to use it, according to the Rocket Giving Fund, which is the nonprofit that manages the golf event.TechnologyTwitter posts loss for 2021, but stock up on share buybackCalifornia accuses Tesla of racial discrimination in lawsuitTesla recalls more vehicles as US agency increases scrutinySamsung unveils new phones as premium market share shrinksThat figure now is more than 67%, the fund said.Another $100,000 went to the Children’s Foundation which supports pediatric research, education, community benefit programs and other initiatives.
