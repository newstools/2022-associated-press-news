NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The New Orleans City Council has been holding its meetings online since early December, but that’s about to change. Council President Helena Moreno said in a Monday news release that the council will resume in-person meetings at City Hall on Feb. 17. A surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the omicron variant led to the decision to hold online meetings. Moreno said the council decided to resume in-person meetings in the council chambers after consulting with the city’s health director, Dr. Jennifer Avegno. “We’ve always followed the guidance of our public health professionals during this pandemic, and we’ll continue to do so,” Moreno said.Moreno’s statement said there will be strict mask requirements for those attending the meetings.
