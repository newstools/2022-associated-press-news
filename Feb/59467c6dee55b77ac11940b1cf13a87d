Tenants used the portal to apply to the Illinois Rental Payment Program funded by the federal American Rescue Plan Act signed by President Joe Biden in March.The portal was opened on Dec. 6 but stopped accepting applications on Jan. 9. While it’s no longer accepting new applications, it remains open until Feb. 17 so landlords can submit supporting documents for existing applications.IHDA received more than 89,700 applications. Of those, 110 applications may have had their information compromised. Lee said they have no evidence that there was any use of the information that was compromised.
