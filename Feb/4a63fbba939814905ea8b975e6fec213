AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Maine’s upcoming budget proposal may have $20 million in it to fight against a group of chemicals known as PFAS as more of the chemicals are discovered in land and water, the state officials said.The multi-million dollar project would sample, treat, remediate and monitor the chemicals known as PFAS, which is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The estimated $20 million does not include additional costs the state may reimburse to property owners whose businesses and health may have been affected by the chemicals, The Bangor Daily News reported Tuesday.State officials said that it will likely take until at least 2025 to test all of the sites that have been identified for contamination. But officials have cited problems like staffing issues and residents refusing to allow the state on their property.ADVERTISEMENTThe director of remediation and waste management, Susanne Miller, said that the effects of the investigation will “extend far beyond the DEP (Department of Environmental Protection) – agriculture, hunting, fishing, gardening, wastewater and waste management. We’ll all be affected.”BusinessClimate change a rising Fed concern as nominees face hearingNative American tribes reach $590 million opioid settlementTesla recall: 'Full Self-Driving' software runs stop signsGoogle's Q4 ad sales soar again, parent plans to split stockPFAS are sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they last so long in the environment.
