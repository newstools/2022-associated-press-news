AKRON, Ohio (AP) — Federal regulators told FirstEnergy Corp. to refund customers after an audit found the electricity provider didn’t properly track $71 million it spent on lobbying for a nuclear plant bailout at the center of a state government bribery scheme.The audit found that the improper accounting caused FirstEnergy to overcharge customers and that the utility may have done so to conceal or mislead how much it was spending on lobbying and why.Regulators gave the company 60 days to come up with a plan to give customers refunds, according to an audit released Friday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.FirstEnergy spokesman Mark Durbin said the utility accepted the findings and recommendations in the audit and that changes in its accounting practices have been made or are underway. FirstEnergy has faced multiple investigations over its role in a $60 million bribery scheme  to win a legislative bailout in 2019 for two nuclear plants operated at the time by a wholly-owned subsidiary.
