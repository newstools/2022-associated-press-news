ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) — Daniil Medvedev and Rafael Nadal had comfortable wins on Wednesday at the Mexican Open and a rematch of their epic five-set final at the Australian Open appears to be on the horizon.Medvedev took another step toward top spot in the ATP rankings with a dominant 6-1, 6-2 second-round victory over Pablo Andujar while Nadal cruised past Stefan Kozlov 6-0, 6-3.If Medvedev beats either Taylor Fritz or Yoshihito Nishioka in the quarterfinals and Nadal does the same against Tommy Paul, the two players will meet again in the semifinals less than a month after the Spaniard rallied to win the final at Melbourne for his record 21st Grand Slam singles title.Paul advanced to the quarterfinals with a 7-6 (6), 2-6, 7-5 with a win over Dusan Lajovic.The 26-year-old Medvedev is trying to replace Novak Djokovic atop the rankings and could achieve that goal if he wins the title in Acapulco.ADVERTISEMENTHe needed just over an hour to beat Andujar the morning after defending champion Alexander Zverev was kicked out of the Mexican Open for violently smashing his racket on the umpire’s chair moments after losing a doubles match.Daniil MedvedevMedvedev beats Andujar to move closer to top tennis rankingNadal wins Australian Open for record 21st major titleAnalysis: All in all, a fitting way for Nadal to get No. 21Australian Open: Nadal wins 21st major; Barty breaks drought“If I do it it’s going to mean a lot, there would be a lot of statistics mentioned, since when this or since when that … it´s going to be fun, but first I have to achieve it, it´s my main goal to win as many matches as possible in the next few weeks”, Medvedev said.Medvedev beat Djokovic in the U.S. Open final last September to win first major title and, at his next Grand Slam event, reached the final at the Australian Open on Jan. 30 before losing to Nadal.The 35-year-old Spaniard, who has won three times in Acapulco — 2005, 2013 and 2020 — has a 12-0 record in 2022 and needed an 1 hour and 16 minutes to beat Kozlov, who entered the draw as a lucky loser.Also on Wednesday, Marcos Giron beat Pablo Carreño Busta 6-7 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (4) and is waiting for the outcome of the late match between Stefanos Tsitsipas and J.J.
