CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — South Africa captain Dean Elgar won the toss and made the surprising decision to bat first on Friday in the second cricket test against New Zealand at Hagley Oval.New Zealand won the toss in the first test at the same venue, bowled out South Africa for 95 and went on to win by an innings and 276 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. The home team needs only a draw in this match to achieve its first-ever test series win over South Africa.Elgar said he decided to bat first because South Africa needs to “front up” after losing the first test in only seven sessions. He said the pitch looks less well-grassed and drier than the one used in the first test.New Zealand named an unchanged lineup. Matt Henry, who took 7-23 in the first innings of the first test after being named to replace Trent Boult, has held his place. Boult missed the first test while on paternity leave will also miss the second because of a lack of bowling workload.ADVERTISEMENTSouth Africa made three changes.
