MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Gov. Phil Scott on Thursday vetoed a bill that proposes to create a framework for registering construction contractors, saying it would hurt small businesses. The Republican governor said while he supports protecting the interests of consumers, the legislation favors larger and more established businesses by imposing contract and insurance requirements that he said many smaller businesses will not be able to meet.“This bill has the potential to undermine and weaken a large number of Vermont’s small businesses – small, local residential contractors – at a time when we all agree we must prioritize new and revitalized housing,” he said. Scott said multiple ways exist to find residential contractors in a community and to hold contractors accountable without creating this new regulatory system. An email was sent to the bill’s main sponsor seeking comment.
