LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico State University is suspending food and beverage sales during indoor spotting events because of what the university says is inconsistent compliance with the state’s indoor mask mandate.The suspension of concession sales will remain in effect until New Mexico’s mask mandate is lifted statewide, the university said in a statement Monday.Event staff and law enforcement personnel will enforce mask-wearing and fans unwilling to comply will be asked to leave the event, Chancellor Dan Arvizu said.“Unfortunately, we are seeing less and less compliance with our state’s indoor mask mandate during our home games, and fan behavior at Saturday’s game was cause for grave concern for us and among our public health experts,” Arvizu said in a memo to the campus community .Many of the 12,307 people attending the men’s basketball game Saturday between NMSU and Grand Canyon University were photographed without masks, the Las Cruces Sun-News reported.Arvizu also indicated the university is prepared to restrict fan access to indoor athletic events until the mandate is lifted.He said the university wants to avoid restricting fan access. “However, we must do what we can to create a safer environment for our Aggie community.”
