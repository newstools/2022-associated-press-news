BANGKOK (AP) — World shares declined Friday after a sell-off on Wall Street spurred by news that inflation in the U.S. jumped 7.5% in January. Benchmarks fell in London, Paris and Hong Kong and U.S. futures also were lower. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday. Price pressures suggest the Federal Reserve and other central banks may need to move faster in raising interest rates to tamp down sizzling prices. The S&P 500 sank 1.8% Thursday on the report inflation was the hottest since 1982.  Bond yields jumped as traders bet the Fed may have to apply the brakes to the economy with a bigger-than-usual hike in interest rates next month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury topped 2% for the first time since August 2019, according to Tradeweb.ADVERTISEMENTThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5% and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.1%.

Others are holding off — central banks in Thailand, Indonesia and India opted this week to keep their benchmark rates unchanged. Meanwhile, some countries in Asia, such as China and Japan, are contending with both higher prices and slow growth  and some are still entangled in coronavirus outbreaks that are clouding the outlook for their recoveries from the pandemic. Germany’s DAX lost 0.9% to 15,352.78 and the CAC 40 in Paris gave up 1.2% to 7,017.53. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.9% to 7,603.97. The future for the Dow industrials lost 0.5% while the contract for the S&P 500 was down 0.6%.In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.1% to 24,906.66, while in Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 1% to 7,217.30. The Kospi in Seoul dropped 0.9% to 2,747.71. Shanghai gave up early gains, sinking 0.7% to 3,462.95. India’s Sensex lost 1.4% to 58,113.40. The mild initial reactions to the price data in Asia suggest “markets may want to look towards economic data to guide expectations, considering that we have seen many central banks walked back on their inflation stance,” Jun Rong Yeap of IG said in a commentary. “We will be getting inflation readings out of China next week, which will be one to watch considering its impact on global prices,” he said.Trading has been volatile this year as investors puzzle over how quickly and by how much the Fed will raise interest rates to tame surging inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 has fallen three out of the last five weeks and is now 6.1% below the all-time high it set Jan. 3. ADVERTISEMENTInflation has been building as the economy roared back from the pandemic. Supply shortages and snags in global supply chains also pushed inflation higher, and prices at the consumer level were up 7.5% last month from a year earlier. The strong jobs market and high inflation have forced the Federal Reserve to begin removing the massive aid it’s poured into financial markets throughout the pandemic. Raising interest rates could help rein in inflation, but would also put downward pressure on all kinds of investments, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.In the bond market, yields jumped most for shorter-term Treasurys. The two-year yield leaped to 1.62% on Thursday from 1.36% the day before. That rate tends to track expectations for what the Fed will do.
