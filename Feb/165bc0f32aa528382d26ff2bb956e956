BOSTON (AP) — Most fully vaccinated people in Massachusetts should no longer feel required to wear a mask against COVID-19 in most indoor spaces, according to updated recommendations released Tuesday by the state Department of Public Health.There are some exceptions.People who are fully vaccinated should continue to wear masks indoors if they have a weakened immune system, are at increased risk for severe disease because of their age or an underlying medical condition, or if someone in their household has a weakened immune system and is at increased risk for severe disease or is unvaccinated.The recommendations  do not apply to a person’s home, where masks have generally not been recommended during the pandemic.People who are not fully vaccinated should continue to wear a face covering or mask when indoors with others to help prevent spreading COVID-19.ADVERTISEMENTMany local cities and towns — including Boston — continue to require the use of masks in indoor public settings.Health officials cited the wide acceptance of vaccines and recent improvements in COVID-19 indicators in Massachusetts for the updated recommendations.Coronavirus pandemicS.
