LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — Terrence Shannon scored 20 points on 7-of-9 shooting and ninth-ranked Texas Tech beat TCU 82-69 after overcoming a 13-point deficit Saturday to remain undefeated at home. The Red Raiders (19-6, 8-4) ended the first half with a 15-5 run, then went ahead to stay by scoring the first nine points after the break. They are 15-0 at home this season. Kevin McCullar made a 3-pointer with 5:06 left in the first half to start that decisive 24-5 spurt, his shot coming only a minute before he suffered a left ankle injury after stepping on the foot of TCU coach Jamie Dixon. A three-point play by Bryson Williams in the opening minute of the second half put Tech in front. Williams added 16 points for Texas Tech, which shot 54% (28 of 52) from the field. Davion Warren had 12 points and Adonis Arms 11. Mike Miles, who missed the previous two games with a wrist injury, had 16 points to lead TCU (16-6, 5-5). Damion Baugh scored 14. ADVERTISEMENTMcCullar followed his made 3 with an assist on a fastbreak layup by Shannon, who was fouled and made the free throw. But McCullar was hurt on a missed 3-pointer with 4:06 left when he stepped back and made contact with Dixon, who was standing out of bounds along the TCU bench. McCullar put no weight on his left foot while being helped off the court and never returned.
