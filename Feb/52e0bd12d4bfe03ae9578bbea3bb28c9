NEW YORK (AP) — The final scores are in, and NBC is no doubt happy to put the Beijing Winter Olympics in the rear-view mirror.The games reached an average combined audience of 11.4 million people in prime time on NBC, the USA cable network and Peacock streaming service, the network said. That’s the lowest-ever American audience for any Olympics, and down 42% from the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018.For NBC alone, the prime time telecasts reached an average of 9.3 million viewers, or 48% down from South Korea, the Nielsen company said.The games never really captured the public imagination, and were hurt by COVID-19 restrictions that had most of NBC’s announcers working half a world away in Connecticut.In a diminished world for broadcast television, however, NBC beat every other network in prime time during the Games’ duration. Only pro football can say the same this season. The Peacock streaming service, which will undoubtedly play a bigger role in future Olympics, had its best stretch of usage since the service began, NBC said.ADVERTISEMENTMark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Universal television and streaming, said Peacock “delivered a user experience that was greatly enhanced from just six months ago” during the COVID-delayed Tokyo Summer Olympics.Winter OlympicsOlympics say goodbye to Asia after a star-crossed runNBC's scores are in: Record low Olympics ratingsAP Was There: Dream Team rolls in Barcelona to Olympic goldThe 1990s: Jordan era takes flight; Magic battles HIV virusFor the week, NBC averaged 7.2 million viewers in prime time.
