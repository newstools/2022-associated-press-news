(AP) — Jordan Staal got Carolina on the board with a determined second-period sequence, then the Hurricanes broke it open with two quick third-period goals to beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-0 on Friday night.The Metropolitan Division-leading Hurricanes finished with a season-high 50 shots, leaving netminder Frederik Andersen with a relatively quiet night in earning his third shutout this season on 19 saves.Teuvo Teravainen scored late in the second for a 2-0 lead, then Nino Niederreiter and Vincent Trocheck scored 36 seconds apart in the opening minutes of the third.Both teams entered on winning streaks, with Columbus at a season-high four wins and Carolina with three straight. And the Blue Jackets had surged to win seven of eight, a stretch that included five road wins — the last coming a day earlier at Atlantic Division-leading Florida.But the Hurricanes controlled the puck from the start and surrendered few scoring chances, whether at even-strength or with its NHL-best penalty kill. They just needed time to finally beat J-F Berube after firing a steady stream of shots on net.ADVERTISEMENTAVALANCHE 6, JETS 3NHLHurricanes have season-high 50 shots, beat Blue Jackets 4-0Schmaltz scores 2 in Coyotes' 2-1 win over Golden KnightsLandeskog scores 3 times, Avs rally for 6-3 win over JetsKyrou, Husso spark Blues to 5-3 victory over SabresDENVER (AP) — Gabriel Landeskog scored three times, Nathan MacKinnon added two more and Colorado overcame a three-goal deficit to beat Winnipeg.
