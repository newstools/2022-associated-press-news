INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A strain of avian flu has been found at a third commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana, state officials said Thursday. Laboratory testing of a commercial flock of turkeys in Greene County has come back as presumptively positive for the virus, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said. The samples are being verified at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa. The previous two cases were in adjacent Dubois County.Pending test results should indicate if the virus is the same as that in the previous cases and if the virus is highly pathogenic. A high mortality rate led to testing at the third farm. Officials have begun euthanizing birds at the farm to prevent the spread of the disease.ADVERTISEMENTA third 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) circle has been established around the farm in Greene County and northern Daviess County. Ten commercial poultry flocks within the new control area are under quarantine and will be tested regularly, the board said.
