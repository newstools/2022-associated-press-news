LONDON (AP) — Britain’s government said Thursday it is scrapping so-called “golden visas” offering residency to wealthy foreign investors amid security concerns and renewed calls for the U.K. to review its links with Russia.The Home Office said the Tier 1 investor visa route has given opportunities for “corrupt elites to access the U.K.” It said that in some cases, the visas have “given rise to security concerns, including people acquiring their wealth illegitimately and being associated with wider corruption.”The visa route, which was introduced in 2008, offered residency to people investing 2 million pounds ($2.7 million) or more in the U.K. and allows their families to join them. It will be shut to all new applicants from all nationalities with immediate effect, the government said.Many of those who acquired such visas were Russians, and critics have long questioned whether the policy facilitated money laundering in the U.K. Concerns about Moscow’s reach in the U.K. have intensified as the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine looms.

And also making sure that we stop the raising of funds by Russian companies on London financial markets,” Johnson said.
