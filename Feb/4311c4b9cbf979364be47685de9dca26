JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Alaska legislative leaders on Wednesday voted to make mask wearing optional at legislative facilities, including the state Capitol, though mask use by lawmakers prior to the vote was in some cases spotty.The new policy allows for some exceptions. Lawmakers can require masks in their own offices, and legislative information offices may require masks be worn “during the delivery of in-person services.”The new policy also no longer requires lawmakers and staff to undergo regular COVID-19 testing. The vote by the Legislative Council was unanimous, with many members not wearing masks even before the vote. The prior policy had required masks in legislative facilities regardless of vaccination status. It allowed for optional masking in the offices of individual lawmakers but called on offices to adhere to masking protocols when support staff came in to work. ADVERTISEMENTBut masking by lawmakers during some committee hearings, notably in the Senate, had become sporadic. Sen. Roger Holland, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, said the panel was “following Senate protocols for masks, and so we are allowed to unmask when we’re in our positions.”A message seeking comment was sent to the Senate majority communications office.
