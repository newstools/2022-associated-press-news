BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — The nurses and technical employees and the University of Vermont Medical Center have reached an agreement to increase wages, the hospital announced Monday.The Vermont Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals voted to accept a wage proposal in advance of the nurses’ contract expiring this summer, the hospital said.The deal calls for a 10% increase in nurses’ salaries effective immediately. Additional raises of 5% will follow in October of this year and October 2023. The agreement also includes $5,000 stabilization bonuses to all technical employees, excluding imaging techs.The remainder of the contract will be negotiated this summer.The two sides said it is unusual to negotiate different parts of a contract separately. But both the hospital and the nurses cited a desire to accelerate the timeline for increased nurse pay in light of their front-line work during the pandemic and loyalty to their patients and community. ADVERTISEMENTThe increased wages are also intended to spur recruitment and retention efforts within the hospital by having an increased salary. “We appreciate that UVMMC recognized the need to increase our base wages to keep our staff here at the medical center and we truly hope that this will make nurses who were maybe thinking of leaving decide to stay,” said union President Deb Snell.“I am glad we were able to reach an agreement and that we can get wage increases out to our nursing and technical employees now, as they continue to work incredibly hard to care for our community during this challenging time,” UVM President Dr. Stephen Leffler said in a statement.
