CAYCE, S.C. (AP) — A resident who died at a South Carolina assisted living center now under investigation by the state had “severe pneumonia” and abscesses had formed in both of his lungs, a coroner said Wednesday.State inspectors found that Twilite Manor in Cayce was understaffed and did not give residents medication or breakfast the morning of Feb. 18, when 69-year-old Timothy Frank Catalano was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead.Catalano’s roommate had called 911 since there was only one employee and the other residents at the facility when he was found, Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher said. One staff member was responsible for 16 residents that morning, when two employees should have been present, according to an inspection report from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.A phone message seeking comment from Twilite Manor was not immediately returned Wednesday.ADVERTISEMENTFurther studies are needed to determine whether any other medical conditions contributed to Catalano’s death, Fisher said. Preliminary autopsy results uncovered the pneumonia, which Fisher said can be life-threatening if left untreated.A dozen residents were relocated to other sites found by another state agency and other residents are staying with family, The State newspaper of Columbia reported.
