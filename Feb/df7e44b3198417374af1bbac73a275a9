HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) — A building that was the first school for Black students in Hattiesburg is going to be used as a civil rights museum.Eureka School opened in 1921. WDAM reported  the transformation into a museum started in 2006, when the Hattiesburg Convention Commission purchased the building. Officials began restoring the building but a 2013 tornado caused damage and stalled the renovations. Work was finally completed in 2018.Since then, the building has hosted events. Officials are now figuring out permanent exhibits for the museum.Latoya Norman, director of museums for the Hattiesburg Convention Commission, said the museum will focus on Hattiesburg’s role in the effort to register Black voters during Freedom Summer in 1964.“The civil rights part is a story that needs to be maintained for everyone’s benefit in Hattiesburg and around,” said Raylawni Branch, who attended the school.
