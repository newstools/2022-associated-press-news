LAUREL, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi county is working to bridge the digital divide by making access to the internet more available.The Laurel-Jones County Library received 2,000 hotspot devices that will be available for checkout to residents beginning next week through the use of their library card. For those who don’t have a card, one can be obtained by providing proof of residency, either by ID, utility bail or a current piece of mail.The hotspots were purchased through a $1 million grant from the American Rescue Plan Act’s Emergency Connectivity Fund program, WDAM-TV  reported.Library Director Karyn Walsh said only 68% of Jones County residents have online access and the hotspots will benefit families who are under-served with internet access.“We have the computers in the library but it’s difficult for people in the outlying areas to get to a computer to get online, especially for education,” Walsh said.ADVERTISEMENT“It’s not just children in elementary and high school who need it, we have a lot of college kids that are trying to improve their lives and this is a way for them to be able to connect and pursue their careers,” she added.TechnologyFeds oppose immediate release of voting machine reportSpaceX's Elon Musk: 1st orbital Starship flight maybe March EXPLAINER: A scarcity of chips feeds frustration, inflationTwitter posts loss for 2021, but stock up on share buybackA hundred community hotspots were also purchased and will go into county community centers along with participating churches and businesses.

Additional funding and/or sponsorships are being sought to sustain the program for another year.
