ATLANTA (AP) — Incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp is far outraising his main Republican primary challenger, former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, leaving Perdue with less than $1 million in cash on hand while Kemp had $12.7 million in his main campaign account.Perdue raised $1.1 million by Jan. 31 after entering the race in early December, according to a report filed Monday. Kemp has been raising money all along, banking $7.4 million in the seven months ended Jan. 31. While Perdue had much less time, he’s currently raising less than $1 million a month. Democrat Stacey Abrams, by comparison, raised $9.25 million after entering the race only a few days ahead of Perdue.Kemp spokesperson Cody Hall said Perdue’s “ego driven campaign is down in the polls” and “can’t raise money,” calling Perdue’s total “embarrassing.”“It is abundantly clear Gov. Kemp is the only Republican with the grassroots support, conservative record and resources to beat Stacy Abrams this November,” Hall said.ADVERTISEMENTPerdue is betting that his backing by former President Donald Trump can overcome his monetary disadvantage, also noting that another Republican challenger, Vernon Jones, dropped out and endorsed Perdue Monday“As the only Trump-endorsed candidate in this race, David Perdue has the message, the momentum, and the grassroots network to win in May and defeat Stacey Abrams in November,” Perdue spokesperson Jenni Sweat said. “While Brian Kemp collects checks from lobbyists and special interest groups, David Perdue is traveling around the state and connecting with thousands of everyday Georgians.” A legal challenge did help even the score somewhat when a federal judge on Monday preliminarily ordered Kemp not to spend money from a special leadership committee that under state law can collect unlimited contributions even during the legislative session. Incumbents are barred from raising money for their personal campaign accounts while the General Assembly is meeting.Kemp’s leadership committee, called Georgians First, raised $2.3 million and spent $1.7 million before the judge cut off the tap with a preliminary injunction.Here’s a look at fundraising for other offices:LIEUTENANT GOVERNORState Sen.
