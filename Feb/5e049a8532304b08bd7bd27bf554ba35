THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A 76-year-old Afghan man went on trial in the Netherlands on Wednesday on charges of mistreating political prisoners in a notorious Kabul prison in the 1980s.The suspect, identified as Abdul Razzaq Rafief, told judges at The Hague District Court that his prosecution was a case of mistaken identity. Police believe his surname when he lived in Afghanistan was Arief.“I am not the person you think I am,” he said.He is formally charged with being an accessory to inhuman treatment and deprivation of liberty. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years to life if convicted.Prosecutors allege that he was a commander and head of Political Affairs at the Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul from 1983-1990, when thousands of opponents of the communist regime were held for years without fair trials.Witness testimony read in court said that people were regularly tortured — sometimes through electrocution, beatings or having their fingernails pulled out — and held in cramped and unsanitary conditions.
