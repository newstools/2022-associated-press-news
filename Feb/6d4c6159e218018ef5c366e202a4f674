Persons’ sister, Rebecca Kinerson, told the court her brother had a strong belief in the goodness of others.“I am so sorry that his girls won’t ever get to know their dad the way adult children do,” Kinerson said.In 2019, Draper agreed to plead guilty to a charge of first-degree murder and other charges, but later withdrew from the proposed plea deal.
