CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Lawmakers in Nevada’s capital city have ended months of debate by rejecting a proposal to allow construction of a slaughterhouse and meat processing facility near Carson City Airport.The Carson City Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 late Thursday to overturn approval granted by the city Planning Commission,  the Nevada Appeal reported.Among the three supervisors, Stan Jones called the proposed Carson Valley Meats site along U.S. 50 the gateway to the city; Lisa Schuette worried about flooding in the area; and Stacey Giomi said he couldn’t shake concerns about harming nearby neighborhoods.The board decision came on an appeal of a 4-1 Planning Commission vote in September to allow a 5,000 square-foot (464-square-meter) building and a 5,600 square-foot (520-square meter) indoor corral for the processing of beef, goat, lamb, pigs and wild game.ADVERTISEMENTProject supporters emphasized a need for local farm-to-table food sources and cited three decades of meat industry experience of Carson Valley Meats’ operations director Michael Holcomb, who also runs Wolf Pack Meats slaughterhouse in east Reno.Opponents said the Carson City operation would cause noise, odor and pollution; use more water than stated in its application; and decrease neighboring home values.
