IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — The foundation of the late Des Moines businessman and philanthropist, Richard Jacobson, has announced a $70 million gift to the University of Iowa for a new hospital to be built across from Kinnick Stadium. The donation is the largest in the university’s 175-year history. The Richard O. Jacobson Foundation announced the gift Tuesday to go toward the new University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics patient care tower. The hospital will bear Jacobson’s name, pending approval from Iowa’s Board of Regents. The new facility will feature single inpatient rooms, state-of-the-art operating rooms and intensive care unit beds in an effort to address capacity issues, rising health care demands and aging facilities.“Over the next decade, Iowa will face a health care crisis related to an aging population with complex care needs,” UI Vice President for Medical Affairs Brooks Jackson said in a written statement. “This new facility is an important piece of a larger plan to meet these needs, and this visionary gift will positively impact the lives of Iowans throughout the state for generations to come.”Jacobson was the founder of Des Moines-based shipping and logistics company Jacobson Cos. He graduated from University of Iowa but was a major donor to all of Iowa’s public universities and other initiatives.He died in 2016 at the age of 79.
