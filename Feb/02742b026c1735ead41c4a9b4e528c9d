WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Soccer Foundation has urged its members to reelect Cindy Parlow Cone as U.S. Soccer Federation president rather than restore former president Carlos Cordeiro.Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs partner who headed the federation from 2018-20, resigned in March 2020 after federation lawyers filed legal papers claiming women’s national team players had less physical ability and responsibility than their male counterparts.Parlow Cone, a former national team player, was vice president at the time and succeeded him. The USSF national council meets in Atlanta on March 5  to vote on a four-year term.“In our 28 years, our board has never taken a position in a U.S. Soccer election,” the foundation said in a statement Thursday. “But the stakes are too high this time to remain silent. Based on our experience with both candidates, our 25-person board of directors unanimously endorse Cindy Cone.”ADVERTISEMENTThe foundation was established with the proceeds of the 1994 World Cup.
