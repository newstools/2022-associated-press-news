But it was derailed by Wirtz’s response when a reporter tried to ask Danny Wirtz, Rocky’s son and the team’s CEO, about what the organization was doing to address the power dynamic between players and coaches in light of Beach’s accusations.ADVERTISEMENT“I’m going to answer the question, not Danny,” Rocky Wirtz said. “The people that were involved are no longer here. We’re not looking back at 2010, we’re looking forward. And we’re not going to talk about 2010.”Wirtz later issued an apology.NOTES: Minnesota D Matt Dumba missed the game with an upper-body injury and is out day-to-day.
