BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) — Bellingham has become the third Washington city to require new buildings to use electricity for heat as part of an effort to decrease the city’s greenhouse gas pollution from fossil fuels that propel climate change.The City Council voted 7-0 Monday to require all new commercial construction and future residential buildings more than three stories to heat water and rooms with electricity instead of natural gas, Cascadia Daily News reported. The rule, modeled after policies established in Seattle and Shoreline, allows for gas kitchen appliances and fireplaces in those buildings. Bellingham’s ordinance additionally requires new commercial and large residential buildings to meet stricter construction standards for energy efficiency. ADVERTISEMENTExisting buildings are not affected by the new requirements.The measure follows work by Bellingham’s elected leaders, city employees and volunteer task force members to develop a Climate Action Plan for the city to be 100% carbon-neutral by 2050, The Bellingham Herald reported.
