Meanwhile, the lower house of Parliament was debating Tuesday a plan to amend the pandemic law that gives the coalition government extra powers to impose coronavirus restrictions and extend its reach beyond February.

Amid the record surge, the day-to-day increase of infections reached a record of almost 55,000 last Wednesday.
