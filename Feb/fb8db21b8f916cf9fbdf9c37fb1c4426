Bill sponsor Republican Sen. Jean Leising of Oldenburg said that left at least $65 million in potential federal aid unclaimed by Hoosier students.ADVERTISEMENTSupporters say the need to help students afford a postsecondary education is becoming a more pressing problem as Indiana faces declining college enrollment.BusinessTrump's social media app launches year after Twitter banUS Fed governor opens door to half-point rate hike in MarchLeak gives details on over 30,000 Credit Suisse bank clientsRents reach 'insane' levels across US with no end in sightThe issue is being weighed by the Legislature for third year in a row.
