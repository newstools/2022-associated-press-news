LAS VEGAS (AP) — Independent investigators found insufficient evidence to prove allegations of gender discrimination the head of Nevada’s higher education system leveled against two state regents, the Las Vegas Sun reported.But they did uncover evidence of unprofessional behavior and possible ethics violations, according to the investigative report.Melody Rose, the chancellor of the system since 2020, complained of a hostile workplace in a a memo to the Board of Regents’ chief legal counsel in October 2021. She singled out Cathy McAdoo, then-chairwoman of the regents, and Patrick Carter, then vice chairman.Rose said they undermined her authority, discriminated against her based on gender and engaged in other inappropriate behavior in an attempt to oust her.The Sun reported it obtained a copy of the report submitted last week by a Las Vegas firm the board commissioned to investigate.ADVERTISEMENTInvestigators said they couldn’t substantiate any legal wrongdoing. They concluded Rose’s allegations of gender discrimination and unlawful retaliation were based largely on hearsay, the newspaper reported this week.They also dismissed her claim she was paid less than male university presidents because of her sex.The firm, Kamer Zucker Abbott, conducted interviews with Rose and 18 other current or former regents and staffers with the Nevada System of Higher Education.
