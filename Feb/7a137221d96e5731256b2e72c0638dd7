BUENOS AIRES (AP) — 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro lost on Tuesday in what appeared to be a farewell match in front of his home fans at the Argentina Open tournament. The 33-year-old, who had not played since 2019 due to injuries, was eliminated by compatriot Federico Delbonis 6-1, 6-3 in an emotional match in Buenos Aires. Del Potro was already in tears as the final game unravelled. The Argentinian said on Saturday he is likely to retire from professional tennis after playing the Rio Open tournament in Brazil next week. Once ranked as high as No. 3 in the world, Del Potro told fans after the match his decision was motivated by his health problems. “This is the moment I hoped would never come,” he said. “I don’t have the strength to go ahead. I gave it all.”Del Potro has had multiple wrist and knee surgeries in the past decade. Delbonis, the 6th seed of the tournament, will face Spain’s Pablo Andujar in the round-of-16 of the Argentina Open on Thursday.Top seed Casper Ruud of Norway will play on Wednesday against Spain’s Roberto Carballés Baena. ___More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
