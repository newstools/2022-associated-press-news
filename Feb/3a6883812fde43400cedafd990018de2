Feuz was almost a second slower than Kilde. Odermatt was more than two seconds off the pace.Brodie Seger became the first racer not to finish the course after crashing on a turn. The Canadian spun around and slid down the slope, grazing the safety nets, but avoided serious injury.ADVERTISEMENT“I’m feeling lucky. My thumb is a little bit sore but that’s it. I can ski with that,” Seger said. “It was definitely unnerving when I was heading toward the fence sliding.“I really didn’t want to hit it and get all tangled up in the B net, because I feel like that could have ended a lot worse ... So I managed to just steer clear.”Winter OlympicsOlympics a sweet, complex homecoming for Chinese diasporaThe Latest: US hockey star Decker hurt; out of OlympicsPutin in Beijing for Games, Xi talks amid Ukraine tensions'Nothing is impossible': Injured Polish luger makes OlympicsAll 56 racers successfully made it down the slope during Thursday’s opening training session.
