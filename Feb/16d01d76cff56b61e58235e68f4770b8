Breanna Stewart and Jewell Loyd have agreed to return to Seattle, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.The person spoke on condition of anonymity Monday night because no official announcement has been made. Free agents can’t officially sign with teams until Tuesday.Loyd and Stewart will sign one-year deals for the supermax salary of $228,094 with the Storm. That potentially gives them one more season with point guard Sue Bird, the WNBA’s all-time assist leader who announced on social media that she’d return for one more year.The Storm won the 2018 and 2020 championships with that same core group of players and were poised to make another run at the title before Stewart got hurt late in the regular season and missed the overtime playoff loss to Phoenix. Stewart underwent surgery for a minor repair and reinforcement of the Achilles tendon in her left leg in October. She missed the 2019 WNBA season after an Achilles injury she suffered while playing overseas.ADVERTISEMENTYahoo!
