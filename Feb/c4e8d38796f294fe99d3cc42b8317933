CHESHIRE, Conn. (AP) — An extensive cleanup is underway in Cheshire after a home heating oil truck crashed and spilled about 2,000 gallons of oil. The accident occurred Friday morning as the truck headed southbound on Route 42, about 10 miles north of New Haven. According to the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, the truck rolled over, causing its tank to split open. The fuel traveled about 1,200 feet into a catch basin and under the roadway to a dry creek bed, according to DEEP. The Cheshire fire department dammed the creek bed downstream from the accident site to stem the flow of oil, the DEEP said.About 100 gallons of free floating oil had been removed by Friday night, and 30 20-yard containers of contaminated soil had been removed by Saturday night. Though the spill occurred in a public water supply watershed area, the DEEP said drinking water provided by local water services and by a handful of private wells near the scene wasn’t expected to be affected. State and local health authorities were monitoring. Excavation work and testing continued at the site to determine the extent of soil contamination. Officials said the roadway could remain closed for the next few days.
