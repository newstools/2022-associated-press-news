BEIJING (AP) — The Kontinental Hockey League is calling off the rest of the regular season and going directly to playoffs because of coronavirus concerns surrounding players at the Olympics, pending approval from its board of directors and the Russian Hockey Federation.The move comes with more than 100 KHL players expected to compete in Beijing, making up 40% of team rosters. The playoffs are set to begin on March 1 after a weeklong break for players to quarantine upon their return.“There are several reasons for this, including the ongoing pandemic and the risk of infection for players as they fly to different cities to complete their (games),” KHL President Alexei Morozov said in a statement.The top eight teams by points percentage in each conference will qualify for the playoffs. That means China-owned Kunlun Red Star, which served as a proxy for China’s national team, are among those whose seasons are over.ADVERTISEMENT“It is important to find a formula that is fair and guarantees equal conditions for every team,” Morozov said. “In these circumstances, this is the only fair solution that will enable us to complete the season and crown a new champion.”Winter OlympicsDay 2 at the Olympics: Shiffrin, skating and snowboardingOlympics Live: Men's downhill rescheduled due to high windsSadowski Synnott gets New Zealand's 1st Winter Olympic goldWomen's hockey world still playing catch-up to Canada, USU.S. forward Kenny Agostino and defenseman Steven Kampfer and Canada’s Jason Demers are among the Olympians from the KHL, which pauses its season for the tournament.
