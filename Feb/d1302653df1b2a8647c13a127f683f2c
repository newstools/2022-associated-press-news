NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Three of the men who pleaded guilty in connection with what a prosecutor called the nation’s worst dumping of explosives still owe substantial restitution — one for nearly all of the $34.8 million he was ordered to pay, federal prosecutors say. Two others have paid all they were assessed.Explo Systems Inc. co-owner David Alan Smith, director of support technology Charles Ferris Callihan, and program manager Kenneth Wayne Lampkin were among five company officials who pleaded guilty after an investigation of a huge explosion in 2012 at a rented bunker on Louisiana National Guard property. The blast shattered windows 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) away from Camp Minden and prompted evacuation of nearby Doyline. Officials said it consumed 21 tons (19 metric tons) of M6 artillery propellant and 62 tons (56 metric tons) of nitrocellulose igniter.ADVERTISEMENTExplo Systems had an $8.7 million Army contract to “demilitarize” more than 1.3 million artillery charges and safely store and get rid of the components. The company went under in 2013, leaving 7,800 tons (7,100 metric tons) of M6 artillery propellant and 160 tons (145 metric tons) of igniter, much of it outdoors or otherwise stored unsafely. It all had to be moved safely to bunkers.

Smith, one of the company’s two owners, was ordered to pay nearly $34.8 million. He has paid about $11,000, Vicki Chance, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Shreveport, said in an email Tuesday.“His outstanding balance is $34,787,792.66,” she wrote.Foote signed garnishment papers on Monday for Callihan’s pension account and for his community interest in his wife’s 401(k) account, with the money to go toward his $197,000 remaining debt, online court records show. He also has paid nearly $11,000, with most of it coming from Social Security, Chance saidProgram manager Kenneth Wayne Lampkin, of Haughton, has paid about $6,700 and still owes more than $142,000.Inventory control manager Lionel Wayne Koons, of Haughton, and Vice President of Operations William Terry Wright, of Bossier City have paid their restitution assessments, Chance said. Wright paid about $149,000 and Koons nearly $93,000.
