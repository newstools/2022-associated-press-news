Miami is hiring Michigan offensive coordinator Josh Gattis to run new coach Mario Cristobal’s offense with the Hurricanes. A person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on Sunday that Gattis was leaving Michigan after three seasons to join Cristobal’s staff. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of an agreement were still being finalized, and no announcement was imminent from either school. The Athletic first reported Miami was hiring Gattis.Gattis won the Broyles Award as the nation’s top assistant coach this past season. He helped Michigan to a Big Ten championship and its first appearance in the College Football Playoff. The news comes just days after Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh announced he was staying with his alma mater after interviewing with the Minnesota Vikings.Harbaugh will now have to replace both of his coordinators from last year’s 12-2 team. Former defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald left last month to become the Baltimore Ravens’ defensive coordinator.ADVERTISEMENTGattis joined Harbaugh at Michigan in 2019 after stints as an assistant coach at Alabama and Penn State.College footballAP source: Miami hiring Michigan's Gattis as o-coordinatorDefense, QBs shine in National's 20-10 Senior Bowl winSenior Bowl QBs audition to be first signal-caller draftedBearcats, Bengals finally gave Cincy fans reason to cheerAt Penn State, he was passing game coordinator and receivers coach.
