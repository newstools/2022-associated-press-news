DENVER (AP) — Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has laid out his vision for how he thinks the state can emerge from the COVID-19 emergency with a plan that emphasizes training for health care workers and improving indoor air filtration systems.“For those who are fully vaccinated, it is perfectly acceptable, and you do not need to feel guilty returning to your normal lives,” Polis said at a news conference Friday. The Democratic governor’s plan aims to reduce the likelihood of future health emergencies. It includes improving hospital readiness with testing and COVID-19 approved therapies, expanding the healthcare workforce, updating public health and virus surge plans and promoting indoor air quality improvements in schools and public spaces.The plan comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to significantly loosen federal mask-wearing guidelines, with most Americans no longer advised to wear masks indoors in public.ADVERTISEMENTHowever, Polis noted that public settings such as small businesses and universities are still requiring masks, adding that residents should still carry masks.
