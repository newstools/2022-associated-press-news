Especially this season, he is on top now.”ADVERTISEMENTAuger-Aliassime led the serving contest 12-9 in aces but Rublev showed again why he is considered one of the best returners and retrievers on the tour.SportsAfter Beijing bubble bursts, can the IOC save the Olympics?Beijing's Olympics close, ending safe but odd global momentFlores hired to Steelers staff; lawsuit against NFL proceedsDustin Johnson says he's sticking with the PGA TourHe played the shot of the match in the fifth game of the first set, returning a smash close to his body and turning it into a two-handed backhand winner.“I had to increase my level otherwise I would have had no chance against Felix,” Rublev said. “I was thinking it would go to three sets.
