WALES, Maine (AP) — Animal welfare officials have seized more than 60 cats from a woman who was subject of a seizure of her cats three years ago.Animal welfare agents, who counted 63 live cats and 31 dead cats, described horrific conditions in the home in Wales, WGME-TV reported. They were at the home on Wednesday. Concern over the cats’ care drove the state to take away 83 cats and kittens in November 2019. But a judge ultimately ruled that most of the cats should be returned and that the owner didn’t violate “permissible standards of care.” This time, a Department of Health and Human Services worker reported the conditions after visiting the house, WGME-TV reported.Liam Hughes, director of animal welfare for the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, said most of the cats that were seized Wednesday had respiratory issues, ear and eye infections.He urged anyone overwhelmed or having trouble caring for animals to reach out to a local shelter or animal control officer.“They can help tie you into resources to help reduce the problems that you’re seeing,” Hughes said.
