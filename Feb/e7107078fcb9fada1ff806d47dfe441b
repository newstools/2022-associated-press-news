MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that he was very encouraged by the COVID-19 trends that he said continue to move in the right direction and show significant improvement across the region. Vermont’s new COVID-19 cases are down about 40% this past week and over 50% over the last 14 days, said Michael Pieciak, commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation, who has been handling the data for the state.“We’re averaging just over 600 cases a day at this point so still obviously elevated relative to pre-omicron but down considerably from the 1,800 or so we were averaging just three or four weeks ago,” Pieciak said. The state also saw a drop in PCR testing for the illness, with the seven-day average decreasing 21%. The seven-day average of hospital admissions for the illness declined by 10%, while overall COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by about 5%, according to the data. In New England, the number of COVID-19 cases is down about 44% and hospitalizations are down about 20%, Pieciak said.
