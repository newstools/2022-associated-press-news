MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing has has awarded just under $600,000 in regional marketing grants to 22 organizations to boost tourism across the state.The Tourism and Economic Recovery Marketing Grant program was developed to aid economic recovery by supporting regional efforts to increase visitation and tourism-related activities. The grants are intended to enable local, regional, or statewide organizations to increase consumer spending, support local businesses, and advance community recovery efforts in the tourism sector. Vermont Tourism and Marketing Commissioner Heather Pelham says that as the tourism sector continues its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s critical to have resources to attract and invite visitors back to Vermont.“The variety of projects and initiatives these grants will support illustrates both the breadth of tourism opportunities around the state and the unique character each community has to offer,” Pelham said in a statement.ADVERTISEMENTAmong the programs that received funding were the Arlington Arts and Enrichment Program, which will create a multi-day Battenkill Fly and Film Festival in late April. Another program was funding for the City of South Burlington to launch a new Annual Winter Lights Festival featuring Vermont musicians, locally-made arts, crafts and food and beverage gifts.
