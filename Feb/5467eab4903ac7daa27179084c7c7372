PARIS (AP) — Six Nations favorite France can pick its strongest team against Italy on Sunday after no players or staff members tested positive for the coronavirus in Saturday’s final round of pre-match testing, the French Rugby Federation said.France is without coach Fabien Galthie, however, after he tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday and went into isolation.Galthie is the fifth member of the French squad to test positive since Jan. 24. Assistant coach Raphael Ibanez will take charge on the day.Star halves Antoine Dupont — the world player of the year — and Romain Ntamack were among eight players who had tested positive earlier before being cleared to return.Last year, France opened its campaign by routing Italy 50-10 and finished runner-up.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
