OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The number of virus hospitalizations and cases continues to decline sharply across Nebraska giving hospitals some relief.But hospital officials said Monday that their facilities remain busy with non-COVID-19 patients, and they are dealing with ongoing staff shortages and a backlog of procedures that were delayed during last month’s surge driven by the highly contagious omicron variant.“We have a lot of other patients aside from our COVID patients, and we have that backlog of people that were waiting to get elective surgeries done. We have a lot of people that weren’t getting care during the COVID pandemic,” said Mike Hansen, president and CEO of Columbus Community Hospital.Nebraska health officials said 496 people were hospitalized with the virus Sunday. That number has declined steadily since hitting a peak of 767 on Jan. 28 after climbing dramatically from the Dec. 25 low of 445.
