PITTSBURGH (AP) — Carolina Panthers assistant general manager Dan Morgan is among a handful of candidates who have interviewed with the Pittsburgh Steelers to replace outgoing general manager Kevin Colbert.The Steelers announced Friday that Morgan, Green Bay co-director of player personnel John Wojciechowski, Indianapolis Colts director of college scouting Morocco Brown and Tampa Bay vice president of player personnel John Spytek all sat down with the team at some point over the last two weeks.Colbert will step down following the NFL draft after more than two decades with the club. Steelers president Art Rooney II said last month the team may divide Colbert’s duties into perhaps two jobs. The club previously interviewed two internal candidates, vice president Omar Khan and pro personnel director Brandon Hunt.Khan and Brown were recently in the mix for the general manager job in Chicago that ultimately went to Ryan Poles.ADVERTISEMENTRooney said the team is not in a rush to hire Colbert’s successor and that the club will conduct business as usual through the draft. The Steelers, coming off a 9-7-1 season that ended with a first-round playoff loss to Kansas City, have the 20th overall pick in the draft and have various needs, including along the offensive and defensive lines and at quarterback following Ben Roethlisberger’s retirement.Pittsburgh SteelersPanthers assistant GM Morgan interviews for Steelers' GM jobGoodell, civil rights leaders discuss diversity in hiringSteelers hire Pat Meyer as offensive line coachBlack NFL coaches lament hiring policies that fall shortAll six candidates the Steelers have publicly identified have not previously held a general manager position in the league.Wojciechowski is from the Pittsburgh suburbs and played at Duquesne.
