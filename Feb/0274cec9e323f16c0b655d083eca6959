LONDON (AP) — England recalled center Manu Tuilagi and Wales selected Taulupe Faletau for the first time in nearly a year for their Six Nations rugby match at Twickenham on Saturday.Tuilagi has recovered from a hamstring injury sustained in the November internationals and was one of four changes in personnel made by England coach Eddie Jones on Thursday.In other changes from the 33-0 win over Italy, Courtney Lawes returned at blindside flanker after completing return-to-play protocols after a concussion and took over as captain from Tom Curry.Kyle Sinckler, who will make his 50th appearance for England, and hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie came into the front row.Maro Itoje switches from flanker back to the second row, while Ben Youngs could become England’s most-capped men’s player of all time — with 115 appearances — after being named as the scrumhalf replacement for a second straight game.ADVERTISEMENTFaletau is fit again after seven months out with an ankle injury and returns at No. 8 for his first game for Wales since last year’s Six Nations. His selection meant Ross Moriarty switched to blindside flanker and Taine Basham move to openside.SportsMLB: Season to be shortened if no deal by end of MondayMLB lockout could cost Scherzer $232K daily, Cole $193KA.J.
