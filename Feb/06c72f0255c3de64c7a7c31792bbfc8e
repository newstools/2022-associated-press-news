INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A group of girls discovered the hideaway of a convicted felon at an Indiana cave, authorities said.Investigators learned that the illegal campsite was used by a man who’s now in jail in an unrelated matter, Indiana DNR Law Enforcement said Monday on Facebook.The location wasn’t publicly disclosed but a photo appears to show a river nearby. There was a tent, candles, clothing and ready-to-eat food.“If you’re going to play mountain man, do it on your own property, or get permission first,” the DNR said.“Privately owned caves, just like any other property, regardless of posted signs or not, require permission from the landowners,” the agency said.
