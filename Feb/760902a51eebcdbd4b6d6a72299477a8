AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Maine agriculture groups have raised thousands of dollars for an emergency relief fund for farmers affected by a group of toxic chemicals contaminating wells and fields throughout the state.Maine Farmland Trust and Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association raised $255,000 to aid farmers who have had to remove their products off market shelves while testing for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, The Portland Press Herald reported Thursday.The fund will provide short-term income replacement for farmers with contaminated wells and fields before the state creates a long-term assistance fund. It will also help farmers pay for independent testing on their farms instead of waiting for the state.To qualify for the fund, farmers must show that they make at least half of their income from farming, the newspaper said.ADVERTISEMENTMOFGA director Sarah Alexander said that the PFAS “contamination is a threat to the health of the people on these farms, this is a threat to the businesses they have built, and it’s a threat to our food safety.”BusinessEXPLAINER: What does Ukraine invasion mean for energy bills?Key inflation gauge hit 6.1% in January, highest since 1982Prices are up everywhere with inflation.
