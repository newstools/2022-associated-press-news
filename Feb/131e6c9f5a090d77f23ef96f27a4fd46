CINCINNATI (AP) — In Cincinnati, thousands of excited Bengals fans turned out to watch Sunday’s Super Bowl 56 against the Los Angeles Rams.Many in orange-and-black Bengals gear gathered to view the game outdoors even as a light snow fell — a far cry from sunny Los Angeles, where the temperature was 82 ahead of kickoff at SoFi Stadium. Hundreds braved the elements to head down to The Banks, a strip of bars along the Ohio River that’s been closed to vehicle traffic Sunday to make room for a huge watch party, with live music, space heaters and tons of food trucks.“Everyone from the city, from 50 miles out is here for sure,” said Bethany Moser, a college student who’s lived most of her life in Cincinnati and came downtown for game day.“It’s been too long. It’s been a drought, so I’d say they deserve this at this point!” she said.Bastian Korreck is from Germany but has adopted the Bengals since coming to Kentucky for college. ADVERTISEMENT“I’m excited for some deep-throw touchdowns, to Joe ‘Shiesty’ to the man Ja’marr Chase. I’m excited for some big plays. I’m excited for Aaron Donald to miss a couple of tackles, and obviously the W for the Bengals,” he said.The win proved elusive, however, with the Rams sealing the game 23-20 after Cooper Kupp’s 1-yard touchdown reception with 1:25 remaining.
