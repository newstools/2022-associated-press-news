PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A disturbing video of a psychiatric patient lying on the floor in his underwear in distress as a dozen corrections officer stepped over him is raising alarm for a disability rights group. The man was ignored by corrections officers doing a contraband search in the psychiatric wing of the state hospital before being dragged away to his room and being assaulted by another patient while an attendant failed to intervene, Morna Murray, executive director of Disability Rights Rhode Island, wrote in a letter on Thursday.Murray told The Providence Journal  her organization is considering “next steps” after she wrote wrote to Richard Charest, director of the state agency that runs the Eleanor Slater Hospital. She said the man’s treatment was tantamount to abuse and said she’s concerned the behavior will be repeated because of poor training, morale and leadership.ADVERTISEMENTA spokesperson for the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals disagreed with Murray’s characterization of the search, which happened on Dec. 10.The contraband search by prison guards followed a suicide attempt by a patient who had managed to hoard pills.“Contraband was found and confiscated. As a result, the Benton facility is now safer for patients and staff,” a hospital spokesperson said.
