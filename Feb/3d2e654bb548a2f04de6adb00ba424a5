DETROIT (AP) — A young woman was found critically injured after she was run over multiple times by an SUV in the parking lot of a Detroit school, authorities said.The 18-year-old woman was hospitalized in critical condition and was “clinging to life,” Rudy Harper, 2nd deputy chief with the Detroit Police Department, said Thursday.The woman has been hospitalized since she was injured Monday morning in the parking lot of the Fisher Magnet Upper Academy, before school was in session. Harper said that the woman was not associated with the school.Surveillance footage released by Detroit police shows the SUV entering the parking lot before the incident. The video shows that after the SUV runs over the woman, the suspect then backs the car over her before running her over once again, said Detroit Police Captain Kimberly Blackwell.Police have since recovered the vehicle, but a suspect has not been identified. Blackwell said the woman’s chances of survival were very slim, but the woman is “a fighter”Anyone with information in the case is encouraged to contact the Detroit Police Department.
