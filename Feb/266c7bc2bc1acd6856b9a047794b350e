(AP) — Nissan Motor Co. officials announced Thursday that the company will manufacture two new models of all-electric vehicles in Mississippi.The company said it will invest $500 million in its Canton Vehicle Assembly Plant and will improve the skills of nearly 2,000 employees there.Production of the new Nissan and Infiniti EV vehicles is scheduled to begin in 2025.“Today’s announcement is the first of several new investments that will drive the EV revolution in the United States,” Ashwani Gupta, chief operating officer, Nissan Motor Corp., said in a news release. “Nissan is making a strong investment in Canton’s future, bringing the latest technology, training and process to create a truly best-in-class EV manufacturing team.”The Canton plant employs about 5,000 people.
