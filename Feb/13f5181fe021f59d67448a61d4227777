JUPITER, Fla. (AP) — Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred entered long-stalled labor negotiations with players on Friday with just over three days until Major League Baseball’s deadline for a deal that would ensure a 162-game season.After four straight days of largely fruitless negotiating sessions that focused on exchanging proposals in areas of relative minutia, Manfred walked from the offices behind home plate at Roger Dean Stadium to the building in the right-field corner that includes the St. Louis Cardinals clubhouse, which the players’ association has been using for its caucuses.Manfred stayed for 20 minutes before returning to where management negotiators have caucused. About 40 minutes after that, an MLB delegation walked over to the players, a group that included Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner, Colorado CEO Dick Monfort, Deputy Commissioner Dan Halem and Executive Vice President Morgan Sword.
