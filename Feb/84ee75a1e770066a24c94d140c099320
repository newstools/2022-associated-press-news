INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — An Indiana Senate panel on Wednesday endorsed rolling back a proposal that aimed to severely limit workplace COVID-19 vaccine requirements, setting up weeks of negotiations with House members on how far the Republican-dominated Legislature will go toward inserting itself on the issue.Changes to the bill approved by the Senate’s health committee require businesses to grant medical vaccine exemptions to workers along with religious exemptions as required by federal law. The version approved by the House last month would force businesses to give requested religious exemptions “without further inquiry.”Opponents of vaccine requirements lined up against the Senate’s proposal, arguing that federal laws have been inadequate in protecting the rights of people to make their own health care decisions.ADVERTISEMENTRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb and GOP Senate leaders have sided with major business groups opposing the House-backed vaccine mandate limitations as wrongly interfering in business decisions.Republican House Majority Leader Matt Lehman said he hoped to protect workers from losing their jobs with a final version of limitations before the legislative session ends next month.
