DETROIT (AP) — Developers have completed a $22.5 million mixed-use building on Detroit’s eastside.The Parker Durand officially opened Thursday and features 92 units — half of which are set aside for affordable housing, according to Mayor Mike Duggan’s office.The new-construction is a key piece of the city’s Strategic Neighborhood Fund initiative’s work in Detroit’s Islandview/Greater Villages neighborhood.Developed by Invest Detroit and The Roxbury Group, Parker Durand also offers first-floor retail spaces. Two already have been leased.The site had been an empty lot and the corner it sits on was an under-developed commercial corridor, Duggan said.“Today, it’s a gorgeous new building that will be home to Detroiters of all income levels along an attractive new city streetscape,” he said. ”This is how we are rebuilding our city as a place of beauty where any Detroiter can afford to live in any neighborhood they choose.”ADVERTISEMENTThe Strategic Neighborhood Fund is a $150 million private-public partnership administered by the nonprofit Invest Detroit and funded by six corporate funders and several philanthropic organizations. Duggan announced the fund in 2014 in three neighborhoods. The program was expanded in 2018 to seven additional neighborhoods.
