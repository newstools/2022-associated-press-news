He won the downhill in 2014 and the super-G in 2018. His father, Helmut, was a silver medalist in the first Olympic super-G in 1988.No active racers have been on the course, which is named “Rock,” because test events were canceled over the last two years amid the pandemic.There are 56 skiers on the start list. Mayer will be the first at 11 a.m.Usually the host country provides the forerunners who test the course before the competitors start for safety and other issues but this time all five forerunners are foreigners: two from Austria and one each from Switzerland, Germany and Italy.ADVERTISEMENTTwo Chinese skiers are on the start list: Zhang Yangming and Xu Mingfu.Winter OlympicsFor Taiwan's Olympics team, everything is in a nameShortened Olympic torch relay starts for Beijing GamesOlympic advisers at ease with COVID rate, see cases fallingAP PHOTOS: Life in the 'bubble' at the Beijing OlympicsThe forecast calls for sun, wind and below-freezing level conditions.Two more training sessions will be held Friday and Saturday before the men’s downhill opens the Alpine competition on Sunday.___More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
