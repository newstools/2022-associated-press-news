BRATTLEBORO, Vt. (AP) — Utility crews in Vermont performed an unusual rescue last week when they helped a frightened macaw down from a tree.The colorful macaw, named Kaiba, had been outside with his owner in Brattleboro on Feb. 6 when another bird flew by and spooked him. Kaiba flew high into a tree and refused to budge.Owner Thea Everest told WCAX-TV that Kaiba is a rescue whose previous owners had shorn his wings, preventing him from being a confident flyer.“I think he was stuck and scared,” said Everest, a Massachusetts resident who had taken Kaiba to visit her father in Vermont that day. Worried that Kaiba would freeze, she contacted Green Mountain Power to see if any linemen could help.“I was like, ‘Hey, I know this is a weird call,’ and they’re like, ‘It’s OK, we like the weird ones,’” Everest recalled.After arriving at the home, linemen Chris Gouger and Nick Bills initially weren’t sure whether their bucket truck could reach the bird. But it did, and Kaiba was soon safely reunited with Everest.While they regularly respond to all kinds of calls, Bills said this was a new one.“This was the first that was actually a bird up in a tree,” Bills said.
