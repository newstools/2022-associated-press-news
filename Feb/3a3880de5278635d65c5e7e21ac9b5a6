BOSTON (AP) — Public health officials in Boston are weighing lifting the city’s facemask requirement for schools and businesses. The city’s Public Health Commission will meet Tuesday to discuss the matter. It comes the day after students and staff at Massachusetts public schools are officially not required to wear face coverings indoors.Gov. Charlie Baker announced earlier this month that the statewide mandate for schools would end Feb. 28. Tuesday’s discussion also comes as the federal Centers for Disease Control eased its coronavirus guidelines  on Friday,  determining that most Americans live in places where they can safely dispense with wearing masks. The agency is still advising people, including schoolchildren, to wear masks where the risk of COVID-19 is high.
