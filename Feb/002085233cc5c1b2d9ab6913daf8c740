NEW YORK (AP) — With inflation going only higher, stocks fell on Wall Street Thursday as expectations build that the Federal Reserve will have to get more aggressive about removing the tremendous support it’s given the economy. The hottest inflation reading since 1982 sent the S&P 500 down 1.4% in afternoon trading. It also sent Treasury yields jumping, as traders built up bets the Fed may have to apply the brakes to the economy with a bigger-than-usual hike in interest rates next month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury topped 2% for the first time since August 2019, according to Tradeweb.Stock prices swung immediately after the report, which was even hotter than economists expected. At the start of trading, sharp slumps for tech stocks sent the S&P 500 down as much as 1.2%, following the usual playbook when expectations build for rising rates. Stocks then pared losses only to slip again.ADVERTISEMENTThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 413 points, or 1.1%, to 35,346. and the Nasdaq composite fell 1.5% as of 1:34 p.m. Eastern time.

Supply shortages and snags in global supply chains also pushed inflation higher, and prices at the consumer level were up 7.5% last month from a year earlier. A separate report also said fewer workers filed for unemployment last week than expected. That’s encouraging for workers, but it could add more upward pressure on inflation. The strong jobs market and high inflation have forced the Federal Reserve to make a hard pivot, and it’s said it’s ready to begin removing the massive aid it’s poured into financial markets. Such moves to raise interest rates could rein in inflation, but they would also put downward pressure on all kinds of investments, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.Following the inflation report’s release, traders see a 98% chance that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting next month, double the traditional move. A day earlier, those same traders saw just a 24% probability of such a big move, according to CME Group. Whatever its size, it would be the first increase since 2018.In the bond market, yields were jumping most for shorter-term Treasurys. The two-year yield leaped to 1.54% from 1.36% late Wednesday, a notable move. It tends to track expectations for Fed movement. The 10-year yield also rose, up to 2.02% from 1.93% after earlier topping 2%, but not by as much as the two-year Treasury. It tends to move more on expectations for future inflation and economic growth.

That’s why one of the big questions on Wall Street is how companies will navigate the higher inflation sweeping the world.
