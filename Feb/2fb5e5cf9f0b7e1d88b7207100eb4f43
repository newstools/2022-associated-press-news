BERLIN (AP) — The Austrian government said Wednesday that it plans to end most of the country’s COVID-19 restrictions on March 5, though wearing masks will remain obligatory in some places.Chancellor Karl Nehammer announced the decision at a news conference in Vienna. Officials stressed that the pandemic is not yet over but a stabilization of new infections allows Austria, which recently became the first European country to enshrine obligatory vaccinations for most adults in law, to open up step by step. In a first step starting Saturday, proof of vaccination or recent recovery will no longer be required to attend events, go to restaurants, bars or hairdressers and various other activities. Proof of a negative test will suffice for those things.“On March 5, the bulk of the restrictions that burden people so much will end,” Nehammer said.The entry requirements and most other restrictions will be dropped altogether, with night clubs reopening and a midnight curb on opening hours for restaurants and bars ending.ADVERTISEMENTNehammer said that a requirement to wear protective FFP2 masks will remain in place “where it is absolutely necessary to protect vulnerable groups,” including in public transport, essential shops and pharmacies. Proof of at least a negative test will continue to be required for staff and visitors at hospitals and nursing homes.AP Top NewsUS: Russia adds troops near Ukraine despite drawdown claimsTensions mount in Ottawa as police warn truckers to leaveMore virus rules fall as CDC hints at better times ahead 'The brand is so toxic': Dems fear extinction in rural USUse of rape-kit DNA to probe other crimes shocks prosecutorsTensions mount in Ottawa as police warn truckers to leaveMore virus rules fall as CDC hints at better times ahead 'The brand is so toxic': Dems fear extinction in rural USUse of rape-kit DNA to probe other crimes shocks prosecutorsTensions mount in Ottawa as police warn truckers to leaveMore virus rules fall as CDC hints at better times ahead 'The brand is so toxic': Dems fear extinction in rural USUse of rape-kit DNA to probe other crimes shocks prosecutorsRequirements to enter Austria will be relaxed.

But enforcement by police isn’t due to start until mid-March, and authorities will decide whether and when further steps take effect with the help of a commission of experts.___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic
