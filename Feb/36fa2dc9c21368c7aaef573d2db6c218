Last month’s report found that the economy was growing modestly at the end of 2021, but was being held back by ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages. The report will form the basis for discussions at the Fed’s upcoming meeting of policymakers. SPOTLIGHT ON KROGERWall Street expects that Kroger’s latest quarterly report card will show mixed results.
