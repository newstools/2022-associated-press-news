INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana lawmakers have endorsed a loosening of regulations on nursing education programs in hopes of increasing the number of new nurses and helping fill thousands of open jobs.The state Senate voted 48-0 on Thursday in favor of allowing nursing schools to increase enrollment and hire more part-time instructors if they have a high percentage of graduates passing the national nursing licensing exam. The House approved a similar version of the bill last month.Hospital officials and health care organizations supporting the proposal have told legislators that some 4,000 nursing jobs are unfilled across the state in a shortage exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic as some nurses have quit or taken part-time jobs.
