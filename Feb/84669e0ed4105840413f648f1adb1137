INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis plans to use a $3.7 million grant from the National Science Foundation to grow its fledgling cybersecurity degree programs. IUPUI was one of eight universities to receive a combined $29 million in grant funding through the foundation’s CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program, which aims to increase the nation’s supply of cybersecurity professionals, the Indianapolis Business Journal reported.The grant will allow IUPUI to offer three years of full scholarship support for 25 students in the bachelor’s or master’s degree programs, said Feng Li, the chairman of IUPUI’s computer information and graphics technology department. Some of the grant money will also be used to support students’ professional activities, including things like conference attendance and lab equipment.ADVERTISEMENT “The cybersecurity students will be well-supported to finish their education and start their careers,” Li said.ScienceUN to finalize science report on how warming hits home hardIAEA reviews water release from damaged Japan nuclear plantUS judge strikes down Biden climate damage cost estimateNASA's new space telescope sees 1st starlight, takes selfieIUPUI’s current students can apply for scholarships, Li said, but the university will also use the scholarships as a tool for recruiting prospective students. The school will focus its recruitment efforts on women and under-represented minorities.Currently, about 36 students are pursuing a master’s degree in cybersecurity, and another 60 students are enrolled in the undergraduate program. Li said he hopes that over time the program will grow to about 100 master’s level students and 200 to 300 undergraduate students.
