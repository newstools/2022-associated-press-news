They have accounted for nearly 75% of new tickets sold over the last three days, and 31% of total sales so far, StubHub reported Friday.ADVERTISEMENTSales to consumers in Ohio and Kentucky have remained almost completely even over the last three days, but Ohio ranks second in demand at 9%, followed by Florida (4%), Illinois (4%) and Kentucky (3%).The secondary market “get in price” dropped 9% to $3,000 on Thursday.“As we have anticipated, we are starting to see the last-minute surge in sales, primarily driven by Californians looking to see their home team play in the Super Bowl,” said Adam Budelli, spokesperson for StubHub. ___AP Pro Football Writers Barry Wilner and Simmi Buttar contributed.___More AP Super Bowl coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/super-bowl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
