Peter Chiarelli as its new chairman of the board Monday.He becomes the fourth chairman in the organization’s 20-year history and replaces another former military leader — Gen. Ray Odierno, who held the position for five years starting in 2017.Chiarelli previously served as the Army’s vice chief of staff from 2008-12 and served in the U.S. military for 40 years. “I am excited and humbled to chair USA Football’s board of directors,” Chiarelli said in a statement released by the organization. “Football is at the top of a very short list of the passions and pastimes that unite our families, schools, cities, and country and USA Football is the leader in how we teach and play — on grassroot levels — this greatest of team sports.”Chiarelli coordinated the actions of all four military services as commander of the Multi-National Corps in Iraq. There, he was responsible for the day-to-day combat operations of more than 147,000 U.S. and Coalition troops. As the Army’s vice chief of staff, he oversaw the day-to-day operations of the Army and its 1.1 million active and reserve soldiers.ADVERTISEMENTSportsNo bats, no balls, no fans: Pitchers, catchers don't reportAt Skaggs trial, 4 MLB players testify they received drugsUnvaccinated Djokovic could skip French Open, WimbledonValieva skates into first place after Olympic short programHe was CEO of the nonprofit organization One Mind from 2012-18.
