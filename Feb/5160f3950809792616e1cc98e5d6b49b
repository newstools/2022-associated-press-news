WINCHESTER, Ky. (AP) — A series of prescribed burns will start this month in Daniel Boone National Forest, forest officials said.The purpose is to reduce the risk of wildfires and increase wildfire habitat diversity.The burning gets rid of accumulated materials that can act as fuels, such as leaf litter and woody debris, forest Supervisor H. Scott Ray said in a news release.“As counterintuitive as it may seem, prescribed burning is one of the best ways to prevent a wildfire,” Ray said.Charred material remaining after a prescribed burn returns nutrients to the soil and creates places for new growth, the release said.Specialists plan and analyze prescribed burns to prevent harming wildlife, fisheries, rare plants and historic sites, the release said.Additional firefighting personnel and equipment will be on site and some roads and trails may be closed for public safety during prescribed burns, the forest said.The forest encourages members of the general public to follow the Kentucky Division of Forestry’s outdoor burning law prohibiting burning brush between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. when within 150 feet of any woodland or brush during the next couple months of fire season, the release said.
