NEW YORK (AP) — Janet Jackson’s four-part documentary on Lifetime was the network’s most-watched non-fiction show since “Surviving R. Kelly” three years ago, and viewership is continuing to grow.The documentary series debuted Friday and Saturday night on Lifetime and was simulcast on the A&E network. With the musician and her manager-brother Randy listed as executive producers, the series was an intriguing look at a reclusive singer yet also received criticism for issues skirted or left out entirely.The first part on Friday was seen by 2.8 million people on live TV, and another 1.2 million in the next few days either digitally or on demand, the Nielsen company said. Part two had a similar viewership of 4.3 million, Part three had 3.7 million and the final part had 3.8 million.Those numbers are expected to grow with delayed viewing over the next few weeks.EntertainmentABC suspends Whoopi Goldberg over Holocaust race remarksLife in chapters in 'The Worst Person in the World'Review: Michael Jackson musical is some thriller, lots badJanet Jackson doc, despite criticism, a hit for LifetimeFox News Channel seems to have minted a new star. Jesse Watters’ debut week at the 7 p.m. Eastern slot reached an average of 3.26 million people, well above the 1.87 million Fox reached last year in that time slot with a rotating set of hosts. Watters’ show reached more than Joy Reid on MSNBC and Erin Burnett on CNN combined, Nielsen said.ADVERTISEMENTGiven that Watters is also one of the hosts of “The Five” on Fox, he was featured on nine of the top 15 programs on cable news last week, including the top four, Nielsen said.The successful launch of Watters’ show comes as Fox News marked a milestone last week: 20 straight years as the top-ranked cable news network.The NFL — and television networks — were blessed with two more thrilling games for the conference championships.
