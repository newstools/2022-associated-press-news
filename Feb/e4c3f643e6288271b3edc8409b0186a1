PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — When daycare owner Heidi Fink checked her email Thursday morning, she was shocked to find a message from South Dakota’s Department of Social Services informing her that the facility was receiving a $217,000 grant.The award for Blue Dragons Academy childcare in Garretson was part of Gov. Kristi Noem’s $100 million plan to send federal money received under the American Rescue Plan Act to childcare centers. The money — which was more than triple what she was expecting — would be used for bonuses and raises for her employees, as well as supplies.Fink said the boost in pay was well-deserved for staff that “worked all through COVID and got very little in return.”Growing demand for childcare and the stresses they were placed under during the pandemic has placed those childcare centers licensed by the state among the list of recipients of over $1 billion in federal funds lawmakers are deciding how to spend this year. ADVERTISEMENTFink’s daycare, which already cares for over 100 children who come from surrounding towns, is hoping to expand in the coming months.“There definitely is a childcare crisis,” she said, adding that she has tried to stress the importance of early childcare education to lawmakers as well as the need to ensure employees gain adequate compensation.BusinessUS inflation highest in 40 years, with no letup in sightEXPLAINER: Why US inflation is so high, and when it may easeStocks slump, bond yields soar after a hot inflation readingEXPLAINER: A scarcity of chips feeds frustration, inflationBut getting the money out the door of the state Capitol had also turned into a political fight this week as House lawmakers asserted that the governor needed the Legislature’s authorization before sending out the grants.The House was set to consider a pair of bills Monday that would do just that, but the governor did not wait for the House’s permission. She authorized the payment to be sent out Wednesday“Those bills aren’t necessary. I already have the authority,” Noem said during a news conference Thursday, adding that the Senate had Wednesday passed a resolution opining that she had legal authority to use federal funds.The governor added she didn’t think she needed the Senate’s resolution, but it showed they “wanted to send a clear message that they agree with me.”The Department of Social Services had delayed sending out the grants amid the political grappling. Fink said she initially expected Blue Dragons Academy to get the grant last week on Friday, but is now expecting the funds to be deposited in the coming days.While the delay did not cause any major problems, she said, “It made me a little nervous whether we were going to get them or not.”The last-minute scramble on the decision to send the grants this week left some lawmakers suggesting Noem’s office had not communicated with House lawmakers who are ironing out the state budget.“When you have a big sum of dollars that come into the state, before they can go out they need to go through the legislative process to get it appropriated,” said Republican Rep. Chris Karr, chair of the House Appropriations Committee.ADVERTISEMENTKarr said he had received a “preliminary memo” from the attorney general on the issue, but said he was still reviewing it and declined to share its contents. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Jamie Smith, who is running for governor, said that the childcare providers had “got stuck in the middle” of the dispute between the governor and the House.“It was sad that we were using such an important population in our state, the daycare providers, as a political pawn,” he said.Currently, only childcare centers licensed with the state are eligible for the grants, leaving out providers only licensed through cities or those who are unlicensed. Noem said she was “streamlining” how daycares can get registered while making sure they meet the state’s safety requirements.“We have safe daycare centers and have more than available in some of our communities,” she said.
