CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) — A former executive with a New Jersey-based company used its corporate credit cards to embezzle $3 million over several years, federal prosecutors said Friday.Jennifer Vandever, 49, of Atco, has been indicted on four counts each of wire fraud and tax evasion, along with single counts of unauthorized use of access devices and aggravated identity theft. She faces several decades in prison if convicted on all counts, and it wasn’t known Friday if she has retained an attorney.Vandever was a senior accountant executive, accounting manager and senior financial shared services manager for the undisclosed firm. The thefts occurred between 2011 and 2018, prosecutors said.Vandever charged “significant amounts of personal expenses” for herself and her family on the company’s corporate credit cards, which were issued in the name of another person at the firm, and also on a department issued card, prosecutors said. She concealed her personal use of the corporate credit cards and directed payment of those personal expenses from corporate funds, unbeknownst to her employer.
