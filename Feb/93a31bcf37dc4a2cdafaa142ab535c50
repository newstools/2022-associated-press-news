DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) — All Blacks winger Sevu Reece scored two first-half tries and fullback Will Jordan added a match-winner in the second half as the Christchurch-based Crusaders beat the Dunedin-based Highlanders 34-19 Friday in a match of five lead changes in Super Rugby Pacific.The derby match between teams from New Zealand’s South Island began the second round of the season and was played with typical frenetic energy. The outcome was in doubt until the 66th minute when Jordan waded through two tackles to finish a brilliant movement by the Crusaders.The move was begun by winger Leicester Fainga’anuku, who scored three tries in the Crusaders’ 42-32 first-round win over the Wellington-based Hurricanes. Fainga’anuku’s pass out of the back of the hand put winger George Bridge into space and he connected with his All Blacks teammate Jordan for the decisive try.The Highlanders led 13-0 after 14 minutes and stuck with the Crusaders through a series of lead changes. But Jordan’s try gave the 11-time champions their first decisive lead at eight points and the Crusaders made the win safe with a further try to replacement Tamati Williams three minutes before the end.SportsMLB 4 days from deadline to cancel games and shorten seasonRussia loses Champions League final to Paris; Sochi F1 axedKey proposals in Major League Baseball labor negotiationsBooker has 25 points, Suns beat Thunder for 8th straight winADVERTISEMENT“I think the Highlanders — we knew their game plan — wanted to put the ball in behind us and really pressure the breakdown,” Crusaders captain Scott Barrett said. “Probably in the first half they had the better of that and probably frustrated us a little bit.“I think we adapted and actually put the ball in behind them, turned their big boys around and forced their back three into some decisions.”The Highlanders made a strong start, taking the lead with a penalty to flyhalf Mitchell Hunt after five minutes then rocking the Crusaders with a try to Sam Gilbert who came off his wing and crashed through the Crusaders’ midfield defense to score under the posts. A further penalty to Hunt put the Highlanders ahead 13-0 in the 14th minute.Reece led the Crusaders’ comeback. He dashed over from a quick, tapped penalty in the 16th minute when some of the Highlanders might have been impeded by Crusaders players who were still retreating. Reece then scored in the 29th minute at the end of a move involving Jordan and centers David Havili and Braydon Ennor to give the Crusaders their first lead at 14-13.The Highlanders reclaimed the lead with a penalty to Hunt but another penalty to the Crusaders put them ahead 17-16 at halftime.In a later match, the Queensland Reds beat the New South Wales Waratahs 20-16 on a late controversial try during torrential rain in Sydney.Ryan Smith secured victory for the Reds with 11 minutes remaining after replays appeared to show the replacement lock losing control of the ball before grounding it.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
