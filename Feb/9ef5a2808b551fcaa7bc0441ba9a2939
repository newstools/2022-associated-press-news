LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Businessman Perry Johnson, the latest Republican to enter the race for governor, pledged Wednesday to bring “quality” to government by improving schools and roads and said he is a conservative who opposes abortion and favors gun rights.Johnson, who is spending $1.5 million of his own money on ads over three weeks, held a kickoff event at a hotel near the Capitol. He is the 13th candidate in the GOP field, though not all of them will qualify for the August primary.“I’m running for governor to give something back to the state,” said Johnson, who started Troy-based Perry Johnson Registrars Inc., which certifies if businesses are meeting industrial standards. He said if he is elected, he will donate his gubernatorial salary. “I don’t need the money. What I want is to have this become the great state it is,” said Johnson, 74, who criticized Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said she should have loosened restrictions more quickly, so people got their “liberty” back as soon as possible.ADVERTISEMENTCoronavirus pandemicUS vaccination drive is bottoming out as omicron subsidesIs omicron leading us closer to herd immunity against COVID?Grumbling grows as Hong Kong sticks with zero-COVID policyCDC: Some people should wait longer for 2nd COVID shotSpeaking briefly with reporters after telling the crowd about his life and answering prerecorded questions, Johnson appeared to oppose abortion exceptions for cases of rape and incest, saying: “Two wrongs don’t make a right.
