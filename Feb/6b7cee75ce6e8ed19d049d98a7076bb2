BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Gov. Doug Burgum has appointed the board chair of Bismarck-based Capital Electric Cooperative to serve on North Dakota’s Public Service Commission until voters choose a permanent successor in November.Sheri Haugen-Hoffart succeeds Brian Kroshus, who Burgum appointed to head the state Tax Department in December. Burgum tabbed Kroshus to replace Ryan Rauschenberger, who resigned after seven years as tax commissioner to focus on recovering from alcohol problems.Haugen-Hoffart said Friday she intends to run for the remaining four years left on Kroshus’ term.The three-member Public Service Commission regulates coal mining, land reclamation, pipelines, electric and gas utilities, grain elevators, telecommunications and auctioneers. Much of its workload has involved determining locations for oil and natural gas pipelines, natural gas processing factories, and wind energy projects.The agency has more than 40 employees and a two-year budget of $19.9 million. Commissioners are elected for six-year terms and are paid $115,304 annually.
