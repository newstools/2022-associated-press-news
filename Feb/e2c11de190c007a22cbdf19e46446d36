SEATTLE (AP) — Authorities say coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are falling throughout Washington state as the surge of the omicron variant subsides.But in a Tuesday morning news briefing, Cassie Sauer, president of the Washington State Hospital Association, said the end of the omicron wave will likely persist for at least a few more weeks and hospital leaders remain worried about the recent wave’s lasting effects on their staffers and supply of equipment.“We really don’t want people to rip off their masks or go to big parties quite yet — COVID activity remains a threat,” Sauer said.The Seattle Times reports that in King County, public health officials are counting about 1,428 infections per day, about a 50% drop from the past seven days, and 30 hospitalizations per day, about a 33% drop since the prior week.ADVERTISEMENTHospitalizations are also falling statewide.
