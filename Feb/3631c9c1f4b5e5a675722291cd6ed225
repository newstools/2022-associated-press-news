WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The long-awaited debut of Moana Pasifika in Super Rugby has been postponed after seven members of the Auckland-based team tested positive for COVID-19.Moana Pasifika was due to make its debut in Super Rugby Pacific against the Blues at Dunedin on Feb. 18 but that match has been delayed for a week while players isolate at their hotel in the South Island resort town of Queenstown.New Zealand Rugby moved all six New Zealand-based teams to Queenstown for the opening rounds of the tournament, hoping the use of a single hub would limit the possibility of matches being affected by COVID. But the virus has hit the tournament before it even began.A preseason match between Moana Pasifika and the Highlanders on Saturday has been cancelled. Super Rugby will decide later if and when the postponed match will be rescheduled.New Zealand Rugby said there was little chance of the virus having spread outside the Moana Pasifika team which has been in a bubble since its arrival in Queenstown this week.ADVERTISEMENT“Moana Pasifika are working closely with New Zealand Rugby and health authorities while following all COVID-19 protocols,” NZR said in a statement.Coronavirus pandemicBeijing's ambitious Olympic COVID bubble: So far, so goodUS buys 600K doses of new COVID antibody awaiting clearanceUS conservative figures cheer on Canadian trucker protestCoronavirus can destroy the placenta and lead to stillbirthsMoana Pasifika already was in its bubble when it was reported on Wednesday that a member of the squad who had not traveled to Queenstown was a close contact of a COVID case. Players were immediately isolated and tested and seven players were confirmed on Friday to be positive.“We also share the disappointment of the Moana Pasifika players, coaches, staff and fans,” New Zealand Rugby spokesman Chris Lendrum said. “We know how hard they have worked and how eager they are to get out on the field.“However, we also remain confident Moana Pasifika can get through this period of isolation and join the Super Rugby Pacific season and will be doing everything we can to support them over the coming weeks.”Super Rugby has long been criticized for its failure to incorporate a Pacific Islands team which would recognize the massive contribution of South Pacific players to the tournament. The termination of the five-nation Super Rugby tournament when COVID hit in 2020 has allowed the creation of an Australia-New Zealand competition which includes Moana Pasifika and the Suva-based Fiji Drua.Super Rugby Pacific was intended to go ahead for the first time this year as a 12-team competition involving five teams each from Australia and New Zealand and the two Pacific teams. But the rise of the omicron variant has prolonged border closures between Australia and New Zealand, meaning the Australian and New Zealand sections of the competition will go ahead separately.If border restrictions are eased later this year, a trans-Tasman competition is planned.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
