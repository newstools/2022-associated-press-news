That man was not hit by gunfire.Security camera images and witnesses linked Carter and Ruby with a silver BMW sedan with a temporary California license tag seen at an armed robbery in a Wynn resort parking structure on Dec. 30.Carter and Ruby were arrested at Bally’s Las Vegas hotel-casino, where police said they found a Glock 9 mm handgun with an extended magazine clip in their parked silver BMW.
