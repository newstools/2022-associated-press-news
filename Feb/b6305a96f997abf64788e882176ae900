ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — After seven years of constant construction projects, the new toll lanes have opened along Interstate 4 in central Florida.The Florida Department of Transportation officially opened the toll lanes that run through parts of Orange and Seminole counties on Saturday.The $2.4 billion project rebuilt 15 major interchanges, and constructed and widened 140 bridges. Crews also put up miles of sound walls and created a toll-lane expressway within the median of I-4, the Orlando Sentinel reported.The project was called I-4 Ultimate because state transportation officials said there will be no more expansions of the corridor running through central Florida. Interstate 4 connects Tampa on Florida’s Gulf Coast to the Daytona Beach area on the state’s Atlantic side, cutting through the heart of theme park territory in Orlando.
