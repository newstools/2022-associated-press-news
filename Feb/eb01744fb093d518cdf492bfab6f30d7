WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand’s five Super Rugby teams and the newly-formed Moana Pacifika will be located in the South Island resort city of Queenstown and matches will be played without crowds to limit the risk of COVID-19 interrupting the start of the 2022 season.The Auckland-based Blues, Hamilton-based Chiefs, Wellington-based Hurricanes and Moana Pacifika are due to travel to Queenstown on charter flights in time for the start of the competition on Feb. 18. The South Island-based Crusaders and Highlanders will travel by bus to the town where all teams will occupy separate hotel “bubbles,” using different training facilities.Teams will use the COVID protocols employed by the New Zealand All Blacks on their northern hemisphere tour late last year. Players and support staff will be allowed to engage in some outside activities while remain within their so-called bubbles.ADVERTISEMENTMatches will be played without crowds under New Zealand’s current COVID protocols. Day matches will be played at the Wakatipu Rugby Club in Queenstown and night matches at Rugby Park in Invercargill.The move to one central location is expected to be a temporary measure for three weeks.Coronavirus pandemic‘Take back life’: More nations ease coronavirus restrictionsPfizer asks FDA to allow COVID-19 vaccine for kids under 5Beijing says COVID-19 situation 'controllable,' 'safe'Virus enters Tonga along with disaster aid, lockdown planned“We are committed to bringing the teams home in early March regardless of the COVID-19 landscape,” New Zealand Rugby spokesman Chris Lendrum said. “We realize there is a significant sacrifice in leaving (family) behind to play these matches and we are grateful for the co-operation of our players.”Lendrum said the move to a secure hub provided the best chance of playing the matches without disruption as the omicron variant spreads throughout New Zealand.“Under current COVID-19 regulations it would only take one positive case entering a squad environment to shut down an entire squad for 10 days,” he said. “The knock-on effect for the rest of the competition would be the postponement or cancellation of matches.“By moving the teams to a secure hub we believe we have a good chance of preventing a COVID-19 infection or close contact event side-lining one of our teams for a prolonged period.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
