WASHINGTON (AP) — The IRS will begin offering taxpayers limited Saturday walk-in help this tax season.Thirty-five tax assistance centers around the country will be open from 9 a.m. to 4 pm. on the second Saturday of the next four months, the agency said Friday. This comes after the IRS nixed walk-in visits during the pandemic, and limited service to appointments only. Beginning Feb. 12, taxpayers will be able to have their questions answered in person at centers in locations including Birmingham, Alabama; Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Seattle. Other Saturday sessions will be offered on March 12, April 9 and May 14. The effort is meant to help taxpayers who need face-to-face assistance, said Sue Simon, a director of customer assistance at the IRS who will also serve as a Saturday volunteer. She said people who don’t traditionally file taxes may need help claiming credits including Child Tax Credit payments.
