A former Alabama basketball star’s cousin has become Stillman College’s third player to make 1,000 points. Trey Petty transferred from West Alabama to the historically Black college in Tuscaloosa in 2019. He scored his 1,000th point there earlier this month against Oakwood University, the Tuscaloosa News reported. Stillman’s other players to reach that mark were Rodnerius Lewis (2014-16) and Markeith Madison (2011-15). Petty is a cousin of John Petty Jr., who hit a school record 311 career 3-point shots at Alabama. John Petty was signed briefly by the New Orleans Pelicans and now plays for the NBA G League Birmingham Squadron.
