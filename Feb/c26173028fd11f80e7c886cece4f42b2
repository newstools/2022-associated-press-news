Ned Lamont enlisted Geballe from the private sector in January 2019 to serve as commissioner of the Department of Administrative Services, the agency which oversees purchasing, information technology, human resources, facilities management and other business areas of state government.Geballe also served as Lamont’s chief operating officer and became a public face of the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, appearing regularly during the governor’s televised COVID-19 briefings to answer reporters’ questions about everything from securing personal protective equipment to distributing vaccines and test kits and reopening the state after the lockdown.“It’s been a little like a war with all the incoming over this last couple of years and if you’re going to be in a foxhole, you want to be in a foxhole with Josh Geballe,” Lamont said. “He was the first guy I talked to at 6:30 in the morning and the last guy I talked to at 10:30 at night.”ADVERTISEMENTCoronavirus pandemicAP source: US urges Pfizer to apply for under-5 COVID shotsAll-out effort to keep Biden COVID-free; no 'normal' yetAP Photos: Indian mandate means masks are all over the placeOmicron amps up concerns about long COVID and its causesLamont is nominating Michelle Gilman, a state government veteran who has served as deputy chief operating officer since March 2020, to fill the position of DAS commissioner.
