SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A fire-resistant roof, at least 5 feet of defensible space around a home, a clearly defined evacuation route in a neighborhood and the removal of vegetation overgrowth in a community are some of the new statewide insurance standards to reduce the wildfire risk of older homes, California officials announced Monday.“Reducing the wildfire risk is critical to making insurance available, reliable and affordable for all Californians,” Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said.Dubbed “Safer from Wildfires,” the  new standards announced Monday outline actions to harden homes, their immediate surroundings and the communities they are in, measures that insurance companies should consider for homes and businesses.California has existing wildfire building standards for homes built after 2008. But as catastrophic wildfires drive up the cost of insuring homes, the new standards would prompt insurance companies to offer discounts, providing incentives for retrofitting older homes, Lara said. ADVERTISEMENTThere are 12 insurance companies representing 40% of the insurance market already offering discounts to homeowners taking hardening measures. Three years ago, only 7% of the market was offered such discounts, Lara said.

Since 2017, nearly 50,000 homes have been destroyed by wildfires in California and taking proactive steps to protect properties before a fire starts is critical, said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the state’s Office of Emergency Services.“Those homeowners that actually take the time to become prepared by taking actions like these we’re discussing today are going to be more resilient and will be able to deal with the impacts of these kinds of disasters and of course recover more quickly,” he said. Homeowners and communities will have access to millions of dollars from state and federal grants to help them make their homes and neighborhoods more resilient, officials said. Stronger California, a coalition of homeowners insurers, said it welcomed the new standards, which reflect input from many stakeholders across the state.“Policies like these are already being implemented by many insurers which will help us achieve the common goal of accessible insurance for all homeowners in California,” it said in a statement.
