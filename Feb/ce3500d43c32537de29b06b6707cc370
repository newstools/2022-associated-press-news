BEIJING (AP) — The International Olympic Committee member who oversaw preparations for the Beijing Games was voted back onto the body’s executive board on Saturday.Juan Antonio Samaranch, whose father was IOC president from 1980-2001, was the only candidate for the sole vice president slot that was open.The move puts Samaranch in position for an expected run at the IOC presidency. Current IOC rules require Thomas Bach to stand aside in 2025 after 12 years as president.“You cannot, or maybe you can, imagine how happy I am to continue working with all of you,” Samaranch told IOC members.Samaranch received 72 votes in favor while four voted against. Nine abstained.Samaranch will take over the vice president seat of Yu Zaiqing of China, who had to step down after completing the maximum two consecutive four-year terms.Samaranch previously served as a VP from 2016-20. He now returns to the 15-member IOC board, where decision-making and power has become more concentrated under Bach’s hands-on leadership.ADVERTISEMENTSamaranch served as chairman of the IOC coordination commission for the Beijing Olympics from 2018 and became the main point of contact with officials in China.Winter OlympicsAP Exclusive: US skaters file appeal to get Olympic medalsOlympics Live: Cross country race moved up due to windSchouten wins 3rd gold on final day of Olympic speedskatingEdin skips Sweden to Olympic curling gold, Britain 2ndHe has longstanding ties to the country.
