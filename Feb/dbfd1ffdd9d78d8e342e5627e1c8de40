The Lakers’ next game isn’t until Feb. 25 against the LA Clippers.Davis went up to catch a lob pass and came down on Rudy Gobert’s heel with 3 minutes remaining in the first half. Davis was unable to put any weight on his right foot and had to be helped off the court by teammates DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard into the locker room.Davis — averaging 23.3 points and 9.1 rebounds — missed 17 games this season due to a knee injury.
