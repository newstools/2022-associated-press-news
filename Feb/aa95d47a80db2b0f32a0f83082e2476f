DENNYSVILLE, Maine (AP) — Maine ocean regulators might close the state’s most productive scallop fishing grounds for the year.The state is home to a winter scallop fishing industry that takes place in nearshore waters.

It’s common for the state to shut down scalloping grounds to prevent overfishing.The state has also closed Johnson Bay and the Eastport Breakwater area for the year.The Maine scalloping season lasts until the early days of spring. Most of the fishermen use boats, but some divers also participate.
