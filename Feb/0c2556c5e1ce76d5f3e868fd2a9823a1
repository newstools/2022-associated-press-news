Poland, which currently heads the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has good political relations and strong economic ties with China.“Our position is that we want to have the best possible relations with China and we can see a similar interest on the Chinese side,” said Duda’s foreign policy advisor, Jakub Kumoch.ADVERTISEMENTThe Polish president has a role in shaping Poland’s foreign ties but is not the chief policy-maker.His office said that while in Beijing Duda would also meet U.N.
