LEEDS, England (AP) — Celebrating scoring Manchester United’s fourth goal, Anthony Elanga held a finger to his lips. No way were the Leeds fans being silenced, though.No chance. Not when they’d waited 19 years to see their fiercest rival at Elland Road in the Premier League, initially because of relegation and then pandemic curbs on fans.Not when they’d already come back from two goals down by scoring twice in 24 seconds to wipe out United’s lead on Sunday.Ultimately, though, the tide turned back in United’s favor to win a six-goal thriller on a drenched pitch. Fred and Elanga secured the 4-2 victory and kept United on course to stay in fourth place.Leeds can’t yet escape the fear that its return to the Premier League after a 16-year exile will end after two seasons. Just five points separate Marcelo Bielsa’s side from the relegation zone.Certainty of its Premier League status is needed to invest in a stadium shorn of much investment since Leeds was relegated in 2004 from the world’s richest league.ADVERTISEMENTParts look little changed from the era that saw Leeds pip United to the title in 1992, the last season before the inception of the Premier League.SoccerFred, Elanga give Man United 4-2 win at Leeds in PL thrillerRiled Lewandowski stirs Bayern comeback to beat Fürth 4-1Stormy six-goal thriller: Man United sinks Leeds in EPLPiatek scores for Fiorentina to beat Atalanta 1-0 in Serie ATime hasn’t dissipated the intensity of the rivals who are geographically separated by the Pennine mountains and less than an hour on the road in northwest England.There were still the chants about the Munich air disaster that killed eight United players in 1958.And objects were showered on the United players after captain Harry Maguire headed in the opener in the 34th minute from Luke Shaw’s corner and then celebrated in front of the home fans.It looked game over when Bruno Fernandes headed in another in the fifth minute of stoppage time at the end of the first half from Jadon Sancho’s cross.The downpour only intensified during halftime.
