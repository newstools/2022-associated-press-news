MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — More than 60,000 homes and businesses were without power Monday in Memphis, Tennessee, four days after a winter storm led to ice accumulations that downed power lines and damaged electrical circuits.Officials with the city’s power company, Memphis, Light Gas & Water, reported Sunday that 90% of homes and businesses without electricity should have power restored by late Monday. The other 10% percent may have to wait until Thursday to have their power restored, the company said in a news release. During the Feb. 3 winter storm and its aftermath, 272,000 customers were left without power at some point, MLG&W officials said. Freezing rain and sleet led to ice accumulation on streets and trees, which sagged and dropped limbs on power lines. Entire trees also came down, also causing damage to power poles and electric lines and blocking streets. Crews have worked 16-hour shifts to restore power.ADVERTISEMENTMeanwhile, Memphis-Shelby County Schools canceled classes Monday because of power outages, problems with heating systems and downed trees, the school system said. Memphis-Shelby County Schools is the largest school district in Tennessee, with about 100,000 students.City crews have removed more than 380 fallen trees from streets, Memphis officials said.
