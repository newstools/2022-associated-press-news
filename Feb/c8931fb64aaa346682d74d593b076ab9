DENVER (AP) — Citing declining COVID-19 hospitalizations as the omicron coronavirus variant wanes, Colorado has deactivated its crisis standards of care that allowed hospitals and emergency medical responders to prioritize the needs of the most sick and injured and allocate staff as needed to respond to the crisis. Dr. Eric France, chief medical officer at the Colorado Department of Health and Environment, made the announcement Thursday. He said the decision is based on information provided by healthcare providers, and he cited declining COVID hospitalizations and case rates in recent weeks.Colorado enacted the protocols for hospital staffing in November and for emergency responders in January as medical facilities struggled with patient caseloads that surged because of people infected with the coronavirus. ADVERTISEMENTMany hospitals reported to the state that they were contending with shortages of intensive care beds and of staff who’ve been confronting the pandemic since its inception. The health department has also directed facilities to transfer patients who didn’t have the virus to other care centers to alleviate pressure on hospital capacity and staff.
