BERLIN (AP) — Wolfsburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach played a dramatic 2-2 draw in the Bundesliga as the league’s players and fans showed solidarity with Ukraine following the Russian invasion.“We condemn the attack on Ukraine and on the lives and homes of innocent people,” the German soccer league said Saturday as it suggested clubs observe a minute’s silence before their games. “War is unacceptable in any form and incompatible with our values of sport.”In Fürth, visiting Cologne and the home team lined up behind a banner in blue and yellow – the colors of the Ukrainian flag – with “STOP WAR” written in English and another message against war in German.One fan at Union Berlin’s stadium held a sign showing a dove with the word “peace,” another at Leverkusen’s game painted blood on her face, and it seemed fans in all stadiums held Ukrainian flags or made some personal symbol against the war.ADVERTISEMENTEarlier, second-division Schalke played its first game in 15 years without Russian energy giant Gazprom as main sponsor on the team jerseys.
