Formula One driver Nicholas Latifi was so affected by online abuse and death threats after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix that he hired bodyguards for his sightseeing trip to London with his girlfriend.The 26-year-old Canadian was threatened after the season-ending race, where he crashed his Williams car into a wall with a few laps left. It led to a safety car, and late drama followed as Max Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton on the last lap to win the world title in one of the most controversial moments in F1 history.“I was back in London after the race and I had security with me when I went to Winter Wonderland with my girlfriend,” he said Tuesday after Williams’ 2022 unveiling at Silverstone. “You have to take the threats seriously because you don’t know what might happen and it is just an unfortunate reality of the world we live in, and there were extreme death threats which went way over the line.”ADVERTISEMENTAs outrage grew among some observers at how Hamilton missed out on a record eighth title, Latifi was unfairly caught in the firing line and took the threats very seriously following the December race.EntertainmentAlec Baldwin sued by family of cinematographer killed on setP.J.

Do I ignore it and carry on? Or do I address it and tackle the bigger issue that is sadly a reality when you use social media?” he said in a statement at the time. “Using social media as a channel to attack somebody with messages of hate, abuse and threats of violence is shocking – and something I am calling out.”The 23-race season begins on March 20 at the Bahrain GP.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
