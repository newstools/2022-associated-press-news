HAMILTON, N.Y. (AP) — Colgate University trustee emeritus Chase Carey and his family have donated $25 million to the central New York school, most of it going to fund a comprehensive renovation of the school’s aging athletic center.The gift provides $23 million for the Reid Athletic Center, $1 million to support the university’s club rugby program, and $1 million for Colgate’s Center for Freedom and Western Civilization.The athletic center was built in 1959 and no longer meets the standards necessary to support a nationally competitive Division I athletic program and Colgate’s 25 varsity teams. Plans call for an arena that will serve as the home for men’s and women’s basketball and volleyball teams and will include dedicated locker rooms, lounges, and film rooms to promote learning, preparation, connection, and recruiting. Colgate competes in the Patriot League.ADVERTISEMENTAt 35,000 square feet, the new arena will provide, on average, 85% more square footage per athlete than is currently available. The arena will be designed to allow it to serve as a site for a wide array of university events.When completed, the building will have: additional sports office suites; locker rooms for softball, field hockey, golf, and men’s and women’s tennis; visitor locker rooms; a new football suite; and a health and performance center that nearly doubles the size of existing facilities and integrates Colgate’s sports medicine, strength and conditioning, sports nutrition, and mental health and performance programs.SportsProsecutors won't file charges against Dodgers pitcher BauerAP sources: Pelicans acquire C.J.
