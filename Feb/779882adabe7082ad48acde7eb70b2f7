BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mostly lower Monday after a retreat on Wall Street, as investors watched for developments in Ukraine after Russia rescinded earlier pledges to pull tens of thousands of its troops away from Ukraine’s northern border. Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Shanghai declined while Sydney advanced. The White House said President Joe Biden had agreed “in principle” to meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin if  he refrains from launching an assault that U.S. officials say appears increasingly likely. Russia’s decision extended military exercises that brought an estimated 30,000 Russian forces to Belarus, Ukraine’s northern neighbor. They had been due to end Sunday. The troops are among some 150,000 deployed along Ukraine’s borders, along with tanks, warplanes, artillery and other war materiel.ADVERTISEMENTThe concern that Russian troops could descend on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, a city of about 3 million people less than a three-hour drive away, has added to uncertainties for investors already jittery over central bank strategies to combat inflation.
