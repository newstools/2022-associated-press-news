TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gas prices rose again in New Jersey and around the nation amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and analysts say prices remain at their highest level since 2014.AAA Mid-Atlantic says the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $3.63, up two cents from last week. Drivers were paying an average of $2.79 a gallon a year ago at this time.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.57, up five cents from last week. Drivers were paying $2.67 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.Russia is one of the world’s leading oil producers, behind only the United States and Saudi Arabia, and analysts say a decision to withhold their oil from the global market in retaliation for financial sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies would eventually mean higher gas prices for U.S. drivers.
