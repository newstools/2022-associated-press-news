MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A man was charged Tuesday in the fatal shooting of a talented Minneapolis high school student whose death has led to renewed calls for curbing violence on the city’s north side.Hennepin County prosecutors charged Cody Fohrenkam, 29, of Minneapolis, with one count of intentional second-degree murder for the killing of 15-year-old Deshaun Hill Jr., an honor roll student and starting quarterback at North Community High School. Fohrenkam is scheduled to make his first appearance in court on Wednesday.Hill died on Feb. 10, a day after he was found with a gunshot wound.
