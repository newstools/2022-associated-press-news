CLEVELAND (AP) — Akron-based First Energy announced it has settled a series of shareholder lawsuits seeking corporate reforms in the wake of a bribery and corruption scandal.FirstEnergy in a statement on Thursday said provisions of the settlement include an agreement that six longtime board members will not stand for election at the company’s May shareholder meeting. The board of directors will now be responsible for overseeing FirstEnergy’s lobbying and political activities while a committee of board members will conduct a review the current executive team.The deal awaits U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley’s approval.FirstEnergy’s insurer will pay the company $180 million less fees owed to attorneys representing shareholders in the complaints called derivative lawsuits. FirstEnergy spokeswoman Jennifer Young told the Akron Beacon Journal the company is awarded money because the lawsuits were filed on behalf of the company against board members and former executives.ADVERTISEMENT“The shareholders are basically saying the company has been harmed,” Young said.The lawsuits were filed in the months following U.S. Attorney David DeVillers’ announcement in July 2020 that FirstEnergy had secretly funded a $60 million bribery scheme to win legislative approval of a $1 billion bailout of two Ohio nuclear power plants operated at the time by a FirstEnergy subsidiary.BusinessStocks fall, this time on Ukraine worries, to cap rough weekSuper Bowl ads look toward the future — and the pastHow inflation and tangled supply lines are gripping economyQ&A: Surgeon General on omicron, masks and mental healthFirstEnergy signed a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice in July 2021 that detailed how its executives carried out the bribery scheme in concert with former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and others.
