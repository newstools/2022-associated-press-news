GRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) — The University of North Dakota says it will be the first among the state’s postsecondary schools to offer a bachelor’s degree in competitive gaming. The State Board of Higher Education recently approved the Bachelor of Science degree in esports at UND. The university has been developing esports for a couple years, including establishing varsity level competition in which students compete against their peers across multiple game titles. The school also introduced an esports coaching minor in the fall of 2020. Both the esports major and minor are offered in College of Education and Human Development’s Department of Kinesiology. UND says the new program has a core focus in sport performance, but is ultimately interdisciplinary between kinesiology, public health, sport business, computer science and communication, KVLY-TV reported.ADVERTISEMENT“Esports is a booming industry,” said Sandra Moritz, program director and professor of kinesiology and public health education. “Competitive gaming is something that is here to stay, and there are many career areas in the field – everything from playing to coaching to broadcasting. Our program is drawing from a variety of departments to create an all-inclusive approach for this degree.”The major will be offered online and on campus following its fall semester launch.
