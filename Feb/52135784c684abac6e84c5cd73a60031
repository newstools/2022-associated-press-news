Geoffrey Meeks said.Luna was wearing a 49ers jersey, Meeks told the Los Angeles Times.Hospital emergency room workers “believe he suffered from an assault at the stadium to his upper body and facial area,” Meeks said. No suspects had been identified but police and stadium security were investigating, he said.“We are relying heavily on video to try to identify the people involved,” he said. “We are going to leave no stone unturned.”ADVERTISEMENTA stadium spokeswoman declined to comment on the case, the Times said.The Rams beat the 49ers 20-17 before a crowd of 70,000 to advance to the Super Bowl.Luna owns a Peruvian fusion restaurant called Mistura in Oakland.
