THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Court of Justice has ordered Uganda to pay $325 million in compensation to its neighbor Congo for violence in a long-running conflict between the African neighbors that began in the late 1990s.The compensation order issued Wednesday came more than 15 years after the U.N. court ruled in a complex, 119-page judgment that fighting by Ugandan troops in Congo breached international law. The sum awarded was well below the request for more than $11 billion in damages Congo had submitted to the court.
