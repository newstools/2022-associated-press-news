MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency plans to temporarily close drivers license offices statewide for more than a week in late April to update a computer system that’s been used for almost 20 years, officials said.A statement from Gov. Kay Ivey’s office said license offices will shut down starting April 18 with plans to reopen on April 26. In addition to new computer hardware, data on file since 1970 will be converted into the new Alabama Law Enforcement Agency Driver License System.While neither in-person nor online services will be available to the public during the transition, a statement said, state examiners will continue to administer road tests for regular and commercial licenses. County offices will be open only for revenue and probate services.Once operating, the new system will let applicants enter information before arriving at an office, officials said. It will also allow users to update personal information through an online system.Fast Enterprises, a Colorado-based technology company, is working on the project for the state.
