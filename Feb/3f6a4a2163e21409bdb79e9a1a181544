SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico lawmakers are poised to legalize test strips that can detect the presence of the potent opiate fentanyl and potentially help avoid deadly overdoses.The Democrat-sponsored bill from legislators in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Los Alamos would lift restrictions on public access to devices that can test for drug impurities. It also gives state health health officials new authority to intervene and prevent the spread of diseases like HIV and hepatitis through intravenous drug use.The bill was scheduled for a decisive Senate vote as soon as Monday that would send the measure to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who supports the initiative.Overdoses in New Mexico increasingly are linked to the ingestion of drugs laced with fentanyl. “Starting in mid-2019 that red line for drug overdose deaths started to curve up from fentanyl ... one of the main drug adulterants,” state Health and Human Services Secretary David Scrase testified testified at a legislative hearing in January. “We were completely incapable of intervening to stop those deaths because of legal restrictions.”States including Arizona already have decriminalized test strips designed to detect fentanyl.
