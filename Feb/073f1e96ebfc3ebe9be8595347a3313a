ADVERTISEMENTThe athletic department has increased its diversity, inclusion and equity efforts since a 2020 investigation found evidence of racial bias against Black players in the football program.Iowa hired an outside lawn firm to review the program after numerous former players, most of them Black, spoke out on social media to allege racial disparities and mistreatment. Their activism came as protests against racial injustice began around the nation after the death of George Floyd and after attempts to raise concerns inside the program resulted in only minor changes.College footballIowa athletics appoints interim diversity, inclusion leaderCollege athlete group files complaint, seeks employee statusAuburn still examining Harsin's handling of football programRicketts announces trade mission to United Kingdom, IrelandThe review said some of the football program’s rules “perpetuated racial or cultural biases and diminished the value of cultural diversity.”___More AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.
