It included servers that power campus technology, including internet, telephones, surveillance equipment and other utilities, the statement said.“We are committed to rebuilding what was lost and making sure this institution has what it needs to continue its important mission in Hampshire County,” Gov. Jim Justice said in a statement.State Superintendent of Schools W. Clayton Burch has directed school administrators to contact families personally to inform them of remote learning arrangements and to address any concerns. “We are moving forward to best meet the needs of our students during this difficult time,” Burch said. The West Virginia Fire Marshal is investigating.
