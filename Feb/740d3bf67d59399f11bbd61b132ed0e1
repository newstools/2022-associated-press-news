CHICAGO (AP) — A 44-year-old Chicago man was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for his role with a violent robbery crew that conducted takeover-style heists at suburban cell phone stores. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said Aaron Clark pleaded guilty last year to federal conspiracy, robbery, and firearm charges for the 2017 robberies in Peotone and Calumet City. Authorities said Clark brandished a gun and threatened to shoot store employees as the crew robbed stores. They say the robbers bound employees’ hands and feet with duct tape or rope, then stole cash and electronic devices and fled the stores. During the Peotone robbery, Clark kicked an employee in the face and knocked another employee off a stool. “No one should have to experience the physical pain and psychological terror defendant imposed upon the employees at these stores who were simply doing their jobs,” prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum. U.S. District Judge Edmond E. Chang sentenced Clark on Wednesday at a hearing in federal court in Chicago. Another member of the robbery crew was convicted in Cook County Circuit Court and sentenced to 14 years in state prison, prosecutors said.
