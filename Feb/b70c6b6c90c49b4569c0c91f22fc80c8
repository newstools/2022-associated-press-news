ESSEX JUNCTION, Vt. (AP) — Semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries says it will proceed with its proposal to become its own electric utility.The decision comes after Vermont regulators told the company last week that it could not be exempt from state requirements that utilities get a percentage of their power from renewable source.Vermont Public Radio  reports that GlobalFoundries’ general manager in Essex Junction, Ken McAvey, said the renewable issue was “negligible,” saying the company will surpass Vermont’s requirements.“For our long-term commitment, we’ve got to continue to be competitive, and this is a significant focus for us in terms of getting this self-managed utility through,” said McAvey.“We’re committed to (a) 100% carbon neutral portfolio, and appreciate the PUC’s time and effort and look forward to moving forward,” McAvey told VPR.
