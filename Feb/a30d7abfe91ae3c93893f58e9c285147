The governor’s office and tribal Chairman Ned Daniels Jr. announced Friday the state and the Potawatomi have amended the tribe’s gaming compact to allow for event wagering. The amendment also extends the compact to 2061,The deal is still subject to U.S. Department of the Interior approval. It will undergo a 45-day review at the agency. The Potawatomi hope to open a sports book venue at its Milwaukee hotel and casino by the end of the year. The state Department of Administration’s Office of Indian Gaming and Regulatory Compliance oversees tribal casino operations and will regulate event wagering. The governor has signed similar compact amendments with the St. Croix Chippewa in July and the Oneida Nation in December.
