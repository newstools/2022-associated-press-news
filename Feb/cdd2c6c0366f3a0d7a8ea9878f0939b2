TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Pro Bowl offensive lineman Ali Marpet caught the Tampa Bay Buccaneers off guard Sunday, announcing his retirement from the NFL at age 28.A second-round draft pick out of tiny Hobart College in 2015, Marpet became a starter at right guard as a rookie. He transitioned to center the following season and later settled in at left guard, where he helped the 2020 Bucs win the Super Bowl and was a first-time Pro Bowl selection in 2021.Marpet announced the decision on Instagram. He did not give a reason for the surprising move.“After seven formidable years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, I’ve come to the decision to retire from the game that has given me so much. This organization and the people surrounding it have helped build me into the person I am today,” Marpet wrote.“To the coaches and teammates, family and friends, an Instagram post simply can’t express the profound impact you’ve had on me,” Marpet added. “I’m eternally grateful. Thank you, Tampa Bay.”ADVERTISEMENTThe move comes just weeks after quarterback Tom Brady announced his retirement after 22 seasons. It also means the Bucs potentially may have to replace three offensive lineman this winter, with Pro Bowl center Ryan Jensen and right guard Alex Cappa set to become free agents in March.Tampa Bay BuccaneersBucs Pro Bowl OL Ali Marpet announces retirement at age 28Analysis: Built to win now, Rams deliver a Super Bowl titleToday in HistoryLeague loses its star, yet Brady's legacy lives on in NFL“I want to thank Ali for all that he had done as a valued member of the Buccaneers organization over the past seven seasons.
