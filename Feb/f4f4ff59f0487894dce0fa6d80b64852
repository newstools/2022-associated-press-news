Their 50-partnership came off 37 balls.Iyer reached his second consecutive T20 half-century off 30 balls. He had scored 57 not out off 28 balls in the first game in Lucknow.“We gave away a few extra runs but I don’t want to be too harsh on the bowlers. We restricted them in the first 15 overs,” India captain Rohit Sharma said. “The middle order coming out and performing is good to see. It is vital for those guys to take the responsibility and finish off games. We lost a couple of wickets but we wanted someone to stay till the end. Shreyas (Iyer) did that for us.” Sports'Wonderful feeling': Eriksen's comeback after heart recoveryLockout Limbo: Judge, Sale, others find fields to stay looseLocked-out players, MLB meet for 6th straight day Michigan State snaps slump with 68-65 win over No. 4 PurdueADVERTISEMENTOverall, Iyer struck six fours and four sixes.
