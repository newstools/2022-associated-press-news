TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey enrolled a record high 324,000 people in the state’s individual health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said this week. The increase stemmed from open enrollment, which ran from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, and was a 20% jump over the previous year. The jump comes after state and federal financial aid aimed at reducing economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak. The 2021 federal American Rescue Plan set a ceiling of 8.5% of income for the cost of health insurance, for instance. New Jersey also boosted the amount of subsidies available for people earning up to $77,280 for individuals and $159,000 for a family of four. The insurance covers people in the so-called individual market. In other words, people who don’t get health coverage from their jobs. For certain lower-income people the marketplace provides access to plans with low or zero monthly premiums, according to the state Department of Banking and Insurance.
