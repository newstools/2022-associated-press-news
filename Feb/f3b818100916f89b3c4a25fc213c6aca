AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Maine lawmakers are considering the creation of a relief program to help residents who are having difficulty paying electricity bills.The proposal from Democratic Sen. Eloise Vitelli of Arrowsic would require the Maine Public Utilities Commission to create an electric utility relief program for low-income people. It would also require the public advocate to create a new commission to review utility rates.The commission would be tasked with crafting a plan to make sure Maine residents will be able to afford energy bills while the state modernizes its electricity grid, supporters of the proposal said. The proposal is being considered by the Maine Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. It’s separate from relief announced this week. The Maine Public Utilities Commission on Thursday approved givebacks for 90,000 low-income ratepayers but it was a one-time payment.
