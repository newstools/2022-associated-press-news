Tamika Catchings is stepping down as vice president of basketball operations and general manager of the Indiana Fever, the team announced Monday.The franchise’s most storied player, who helped Indiana win a WNBA championship in 2012 and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame last year, had held the front-office positions since 2017, and the team has struggled under her leadership.“While change is never easy, now it’s time to take a step back from my role as general manager, take a well-earned rest, and prioritize my family, my philanthropy, our community, and my other passions,” Catchings said in a statement. “The opportunity to be drafted into this world-class Fever organization, to be embraced by these amazing owners, fans, coaches, teammates and community, and to be given the chance to grow as an executive leader has been a true blessing.”Catchings will be replaced by Lin Dunn, who coached Indiana’s championship-winning squad.ADVERTISEMENTIndiana has finished out of the playoffs every season since Catchings retired in 2016. The team’s last two first-round draft picks — Lauren Cox and Kysre Gondrezick — were both cut by the organization before they had a chance to develop. Cox now plays for Los Angeles and Gondrezick was recently signed by the Chicago Sky.SportsRussian skater can compete, but medal ceremony won't be heldGonzaga back at No. 1 in AP Top 25; Wyoming enters pollAnalysis: Built to win now, Rams deliver a Super Bowl titleKupp caps triple crown season with Super Bowl MVPThe Fever have the No. 2 pick in the April draft after winning just six games each of the past two seasons.“Tamika has been instrumental in making the dream of professional sports a reality for future generations of female athletes.
