LEEDS, England (AP) — Tottenham became the latest team to rip through Leeds’ fragile defense, winning 4-0 at Elland Road on Saturday to give manager Antonio Conte something to smile about this time.Matt Doherty, Dejan Kulusevski and Harry Kane scored goals in the opening 27 minutes and Leeds’ players were booed off at halftime.Son Heung-min added a fourth in the 85th minute, running onto an exquisite long pass from Kane to finish past goalkeeper Illan Meslier, and it was the 20th goal that Leeds has conceded in five games in February. That’s a Premier League record for goals allowed for a single month.The win saw Tottenham bounce back from a 1-0 loss at Burnley on Wednesday, after which an emotional Conte cast doubt on his own ability to get Tottenham competing for titles and even questioned his future at the club.While Spurs climbed into seventh place and are still well in the fight for the Champions League qualification spots, Leeds is just three points above the bottom three and undoubtedly embroiled in a relegation scrap.ADVERTISEMENTSince drawing 3-3 at Aston Villa, Leeds has lost 3-0 at Everton, 4-2 at home to Manchester United, 6-0 at Liverpool and now been beaten heavily by Tottenham, with manager Marcelo Bielsa refusing to eschew his attacking philosophy that can appear naïve against the big teams.SportsManfred joins in, MLB lockout talks appear to gain momentumLockout Limbo: Judge, Sale, others find fields to stay looseHarden makes 76ers debut in blowout win over TimberwolvesClippers edge Lakers 105-102 for 6th straight rivalry winIt was another clinic of center-forward play by Kane, who set up a slew of chances by dropping deep and threading through-balls.
