The rescued passengers were being transported to Corfu.Six boats from Greece’s coast guard and navy participated in the rescue along with four helicopters, an Italian customs inspection boat and several passing vessels, Senior coast guard official Nikos Lagadianos said.___This version has been corrected to show the ferry is Italian-flagged, not Greek-owned.
