BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The North Dakota Department of Health said Monday it will make more than 1.5 million free at-home COVID-19 test kits available statewide. The kits will supplement the ongoing federal program that is making free tests available. The kits are being distributed statewide and will be available for pickup beginning Tuesday. Health officials suggest citizens pickup tests as needed, with a start of two tests per household member. “These at-home COVID-19 tests will continue to expand testing access to all citizens. Individuals may choose to use these tests to determine their COVID-19 status before attending family gatherings, going to work or school, visiting loved ones in long-term care facilities and attending sporting events or any other large event,” said Gov. Doug Burgum. “Along with vaccination, participating in COVID-19 testing continues to be an important action in slowing the spread of the virus in our communities.” ADVERTISEMENTIndividuals can find locations where they can pickup free tests on the state Department of Health website. The sites will be updated twice a week as more locations receive test shipments. Two types of tests have arrived initially. They include Celltrion which is authorized for individuals age 14 and older and iHealth, which is authorized for people age 2 and older. The Department of Health ordered the tests with funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
