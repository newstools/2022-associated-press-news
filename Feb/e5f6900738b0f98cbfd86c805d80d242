He faces up to 20 years in prison at sentencing scheduled for June 1.Prosecutors said Jones targeted schools in Missouri and Tennessee that benefited from the Federal Communications Commission’s E-Rate Program, which provides money to needy schools for internet access and telecommunications services. During a 10-year period, Jones paid kickbacks to an E-Rate consultant working with the schools involved in the case. Jones, one of his employees, and the school E-Rate consultant lied on documents sent to the E-Rate Program, using the schools as vehicles to fraudulently obtain money for Jones, prosecutors said. The loss to the E-Rate Program was about $6.9 million dollars, prosecutors said.
