BOSTON (AP) — The public was welcomed back Tuesday into the Massachusetts Statehouse nearly two years after the historic building and center of government for the state was largely closed in the early days of the pandemic.Since March 2020, the Statehouse has had its doors shuttered to all but lawmakers, Statehouse staffers and reporters.Masks will be required, as well as proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative test from no more than one day before seeking entry.The building has been closed to the general public for more than 700 days, far longer than nearly any other state capitol during the pandemic.The plan to welcome back the public comes as a COVID-19 surge driven by the highly contagious omicron variant continues to subside.Lawmakers had come under criticism from some for keeping the building closed to the public for so long.During the past two years, hearings and legislative sessions have largely been conducted both in person and remotely in part to ensure public access.ADVERTISEMENTThere is no change with respect to the format of committee hearings or public events, including those sponsored by House and Senate members, according to Democratic Senate President Karen Spilka.Coronavirus pandemicGov Dan McKee formally announces gubernatorial bidAfter two years, Massachusetts Statehouse reopens to publicFox News' Cavuto returns to work after bout with COVID-19Supreme Court won't hear challenge to Maine vaccine mandateSpilka and Democratic House Speaker Ronald Mariano have said the rules about entry into the building will be under ongoing scrutiny.“With public health data constantly evolving, we will review these requirements on a weekly basis,” the two said in a statement when announcing the re-opening last week. “We look forward to seeing the public in the State House.”Children under 5 will be exempt from the mask, vaccine or testing mandate.Visitors will be limited to entering the Statehouse between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. but can remain in the building if the House or the Senate are still in session, so they can view the proceedings.In December, the Massachusetts House began requiring Statehouse employees to show that they have been vaccinated; received a qualifying disability or medical condition; or received an accommodation due to a sincerely held religious belief to enter the building.
