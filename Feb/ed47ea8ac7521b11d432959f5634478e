BOSTON (AP) — Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has been targeted in early mornings by people outside her home protesting her city employee coronavirus vaccine mandate, filed an ordinance Monday that would limit when protesters can picket.The rule would allow protesters to demonstrate outside an individual home only from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m., her office announced. It would protect any home, not just those of elected officials.It would not affect marches or protests passing through residential areas that are not aimed at a particular home. Protesters have been shouting loudly, banging drums and blowing whistles outside the mayor’s Roslindale home as early as 7 a.m. for weeks, disrupting not only the mayor’s family, but also her neighbors.“Boston has a strong legacy of activism, and it’s important to uphold and protect the ability to speak out and advocate fiercely to keep our democracy strong,” Wu said in a statement. “But in a moment of divided national politics, we can’t normalize the harassment and hate spilling over into our communities.”ADVERTISEMENTThe city said similar regulations in other states have been upheld in court.Coronavirus pandemicSmall Japan border easing stirs hope, worry for foreignersS.
