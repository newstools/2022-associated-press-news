BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota’s Health Department is offering a cash incentive for people who obtain a temporary certification to work in a nursing home in the state.The goal of the “emergency recruit program” is to help curb staffing shortages amid the coronavirus pandemic. The program offers sign-on bonuses of $2,000 for up to 100 people who get a temporary aide certification, which involves taking a free 8-hour online course. Nursing aides who have not worked in a long-term care facility for at least six months also are eligible for the program if they return to a facility.Shelly Peterson, president of the North Dakota Long Term Care Association, said there are more than 1,000 openings at the 78 nursing home facilities in the state.“Every one of them is in need,” she said.The program will run through May 30 or with the approval of 100 applicants, whichever comes first.
