CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — New Hampshire schools no longer can shift to fully remote or hybrid instruction due to COVID-19 outbreaks.Both the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules and the State Board of Education approved new rules Friday requiring schools to provide in-person instruction except in cases of inclement weather or when a parent requests remote learning for an individual student.The Senate on Thursday killed a bill aimed at blocking the rules. The House is considering a similar bill.
