PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A retired Rhode Island fire lieutenant accused of threatening to harm or kill public officials in a series of emails and online postings over a period of several years was charged in a federal criminal complaint, prosecutors said Thursday.Barry J. LaFleur, 57, of Cranston, a retired Warwick Fire Department lieutenant with 23 years of service, made an initial court appearance on Wednesday, according to a statement from the office of U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island, Zachary Cunha.The exact charge he faces is “threats to injure the person of another transmitted in interstate or foreign commerce.”An email seeking comment was left with LaFleur’s federal public defender.LaFleur transmitted the alleged threats both while employed and after his retirement, prosecutors said.In one post, LaFleur wrote “Warwick, Rhode Island is begging” to be the “epicenter of a hideous workplace slaughter,” according to an affidavit in the case.ADVERTISEMENTOn another occasion, LaFleur posted that he wanted to kill the police and fire chiefs and the mayor, according to the affidavit.The posts date to 2014 when LaFleur was temporarily out on leave for a physical work-related injury, but failed to return to work, and was placed on administrative leave without pay, according to the affidavit. At that time, he sent 37 emails to the then-fire chief, some with implied threats of physical harm, the affidavit said.One threatening online post was made as recently as last month, authorities said.LaFleur was released on $10,000 unsecured bond to home detention with GPS monitoring.
