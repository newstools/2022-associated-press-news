A look at the upcoming weekend around the Big 12 Conference:GAME OF THE WEEKENDThe Big 12′s best team this season meets the league’s best — and the nation’s best, for that matter — from last season when No. 5 Kansas heads to No. 10 Baylor on Saturday night. The Jayhawks (23-4, 12-2) can essentially put away the Bears (23-5, 11-4) in the race for the regular-season title with a season sweep of the defending national champions. Kansas has won four straight following a nip-and-tuck loss to Texas, while the Bears have won four of their past five since their loss in Lawrence with the only blemish against No. 11 Texas Tech. “You know, every test is opportunity for us; we are getting better. We’ve progressed throughout the year,” Jayhawks forward Jalen Wilson said,. “We continue to get better, so I think there’s a whole lot of opportunity.” LOOKING AHEADADVERTISEMENTSpeaking of the Red Raiders (22-6, 11-4), they have a tough game against TCU on Saturday night as they try to keep their hopes alive of landing the No. 1 seed for the Big 12 Tournament.
