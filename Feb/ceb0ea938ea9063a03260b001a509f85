INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) — An outside firm will investigate how an Independence police officer was paid $160,000 in overtime last year, allegedly for doing construction work on the city’s police building. City Manager Zach Walker said a whistleblower brought the issue to his attention, The Kansas City Star reported. “I think at best we’ve got gross misconduct and very poor judgment from management within the police department and at worst we may have fraudulent activity,” Walker said.The officer was paid for 2,800 hours of overtime in 2021, Walker said.No one has yet been disciplined. Walker ordered a stop to all construction work at the police building and payment of any overtime not related to law enforcement work. Walker said the department should have consulted with the public works department or put out a bid for construction work. The city finance and human resources departments spotted the unusually high pay last year but were told by police department leaders the overtime was authorized, the city manager said. Former Police Chief Brad Halsey retired in December after five years on the job.
