LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Karachi Kings finally broke their eight-match losing streak in the Pakistan Super League with a 22-run win over Lahore Qalandars, while defending champion Multan Sultans recorded the second-highest total in PSL history to set up a record-breaking 117-run victory over Quetta Gladiators on Friday.On the same wicket where Multan had earlier racked up 245-3, Karachi pinned down Lahore to 127-9 after getting bowled out for 149 in 19.5 overs.Left-arm fast bowler Mir Hamza took the heart out of Lahore’s chase with 4-27 that included key wickets of Fakhar Zaman (1) off his first ball and then shut down the chase by removing Harry Brook (26) and David Wiese (31) in the death overs.“We were 10-15 runs short, but we got the key wicket of Fakhar Zaman early and it helped us,” Karachi captain Babar Azam said.Earlier, young fast bowler Zaman Khan (4-16) and Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan (4-17) struck with regular intervals and restricted Karachi to what appeared to be a below-par total.ADVERTISEMENTRashid entertained a capacity crowd at the Gaddafi Stadium in his second last PSL game this season when he had Pakistan under-19 captain Qasim Akram (26) clean bowled and followed it up by having top-scorer Babar (39) stumped in successive overs.

Quetta are in the bottom half of the table with six points from nine games with just one game remaining against last-place Karachi Kings on Sunday.The in-form opening pair of Rizwan and Shan Masood, who made 57, laid the foundation of a big total with a century-stand in the first 10 overs.South Africa’s left-hander Rossouw then hit boundaries at will after Masood was trapped leg before wicket in the 12th over by tall Pakistan international fast bowler Mohammad Irfan in his first PSL game this season.Rossouw smashed nine fours and four sixes and Multan blasted 81 runs off the last five overs against expensive fast bowlers Sohail Tanvir (0-52) and Ghulam Mudassar (1-56). Spinner Noor Ahmed was also not spared, finishing with 0-52.____More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
