LAS VEGAS (AP) — More Nevada motorists are going green when hitting the road.The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Monday that the state has seen a huge leap in the number of electric vehicle registrations in the past two years.Electric vehicle registrations went from 7,381 in 2019 to 17,162 last year, according to the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles. That’s an increase of over 130%.Kevin Malone, a DMV spokesman, says this is the effect of the state adopting regulations that mandate manufacturers have more eco-friendly cars as a percentage of their sales.The Clean Cars Nevada regulation wants more opportunities for drivers to buy electric or hybrid cars and trucks starting in 2024. It’s part of a growing effort to tighten vehicle emission standards and reduce pollution.
