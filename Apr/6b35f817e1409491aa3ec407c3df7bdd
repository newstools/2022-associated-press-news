BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Atlético Madrid lost 1-0 at Mallorca in the Spanish league on Saturday as Diego Simeone’s side stumbled again after its defeat at Manchester City.Atlético will now have to regroup before it hosts City on Wednesday needing to overturn a 1-0 first-leg loss to Pep Guardiola’s side to reach the Champions League semifinals.Mallorca forward Vedat Muriqi scored the game’s only goal in the 68th minute when he converted a penalty kick earned by Pablo Maffeo after he was fouled by Reinildo Mandava. Muriqi rifled the penalty into the top right corner, well beyond the reach of goalkeeper Jan Oblak.Atlético, which had been playing its best soccer of the season until recently, generated very little in attack as its run of six straight victories in the domestic league came to an end. Atlético was left in fourth place.“Surely the game (at City) took its toll, we were a bit tired and didn’t play the game we wanted to,” Oblak said. “Now we have to play City again and we will have to do more to win the game on Wednesday.”ADVERTISEMENTMallorca midfielder Iddrisu Baba had to be carried off on a stretcher in stoppage time after he was hit in the head by a ball powerfully struck by Thomas Lemar.SoccerRennes beats Reims 3-2 to go 2nd in French league Mount, Werner doubles as Chelsea routs Southampton 6-0Boost for Marsch's Leeds with 3-0 win at Watford Lewandowski scores late as Bayern beats Augsburg 1-0Mallorca ended a run of seven consecutive losses, including a 1-0 defeat to Getafe in coach Javier Aguirre’s debut last round.
