PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Temple named Diane Richardson its new women’s basketball coach on Tuesday. Richardson went 80-66 in five seasons at Towson, including this season’s school-record 24 wins and a berth in the NIT. She also led Towson to the NCAA Tournament in 2019, when the Tigers finished the season with a 20-13 overall record for just its second 20-win season in program history. Towson won the Colonial Athletic Association Tournament championship in 2019.Under Richardson, Towson’s Kionna Jeter became the first player in program history to be selected in the WNBA Draft when she was drafted in the third round in 2021. “Temple has a rich tradition of success in women’s basketball, and I am thrilled to take over this program and work hard to take it to the next level,” Richardson said. She replaces Tonya Cardoza, who was fired in March with a 251-188 record in 14 seasons.ADVERTISEMENTAs the 1979 NCAA Regional Champion in the 200- and 400-meter races, Richardson earned a spot on the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but did not compete. Richardson spent time in corporate America before quitting in 1995 to coach.March Madness NCAA TournamentKansas comes back, wins NCAA title 3 years in the makingThousands pour into Lawrence streets to celebrate Kansas winLa Salle hires former Penn, Temple coach Fran DunphyHobbled Bacot comes up short in Tar Heels' NCAA title push “Diane is an amazing woman who has had incredible success in not just coaching, but all aspects of her life.
