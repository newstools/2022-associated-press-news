The committees co-chairs praised the the panel’s Republicans and Democrats for working to establish consensus. “This is what Maine people expect from their government — collaboration and common sense,” said Sen. Cathy Breen, D-Falmouth.ADVERTISEMENTThe governor originally proposed $500 checks, then $750 checks, then $850 checks, as the surplus grew. The current projections called for a budget surplus topping $1 billion through June 2023. The full Legislature will take up the budget in coming days. Lawmakers are scheduled to adjourn on Wednesday.
