ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — The Texas Rangers placed newly acquired right-hander Garrett Richards on the 10-day injured list Thursday, and put former closer Jose Leclerc on the 60-day IL as he continues to recover from Tommy John surgery in his right elbow early last year. Those moves were part of Texas finalizing the 28-player roster for the start of its season Friday night in Toronto. The Rangers also selected the contracts of right-handed relievers Greg Holland and Matt Bush, and utility infielder Charlie Culberson from Triple-A Round Rock after all went to spring training on minor league deals. Richards, who signed a deal at the start of spring training, is dealing with a blister on his right middle finger. The Rangers plan to use the veteran pitcher as a reliever, a role the former starter had for his final 22 appearances with the Boston Red Sox last season. Holland is a three-time All-Star reliever who pitched the past two seasons for the Kansas City Royals. The 36-year-old Bush hadn’t pitched since the first week of last season because of right elbow inflammation when he was activated from the 60-day injured list before the finale last October and struck out one in a perfect sixth inning.
