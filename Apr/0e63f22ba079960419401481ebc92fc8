MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester United captain Harry Maguire has received a bomb threat, leading to police searching his house in northern England.Maguire lives at the property with his fiancée Fern Hawkins and their two children.“Cheshire Police were called to reports of a bomb threat,” police said in a statement. “No evacuations took place, but as a precautionary measure a police explosives dog has attended the address this afternoon, Thursday 21 April, to conduct a search of the gardens and surrounding area.”There has been increasingly volatile language aimed at Maguire over United’s performances in recent weeks, with the team losing 4-0 at Liverpool in the Premier League on Tuesday.“The safety of his family and those around him is obviously Harry’s number one priority,” the England defender’s management team said in a statement. “He will continue to prepare for this weekend’s fixture as normal and we will not be commenting in any further detail at this time.”United plays at Arsenal on Saturday. ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
