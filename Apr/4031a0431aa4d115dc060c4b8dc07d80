NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A woman who is originally from New York has become the first woman to command a Louisiana National Guard firing battery, the guard says. Lt. Melissa Liotta leads nearly 90 soldiers as part of what the state National Guard describes as its oldest and most historic unit. “It is an incredible and surreal feeling,” Liotta said in a recent news release. “It is just another example of how much progress we are making in the Army towards gender equality and the integration of females in combat arms.”She was installed Feb. 13 as commander of B Battery, 1st Battalion, 1-141st Field Artillery Regiment. The 141st is nicknamed the “Washington Artillery” and was organized in New Orleans in 1838. Liotta says her biggest initial challenge will be to help bring the battery together. Over the past year, some members have been working on responses to disasters or the COVID-19 pandemic and some were sent to the Southwest border.
