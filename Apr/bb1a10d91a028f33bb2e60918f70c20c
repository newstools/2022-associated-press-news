CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — The Christchurch-based Crusaders held on through a scoreless second half and with 14 men for the last three minutes to beat the Dunedin-based Highlanders 17-14 Friday in Super Rugby Pacific.Both teams scored two tries in a first half of tit-for-tat scoring and a penalty by All Blacks flyhalf Richie Mo’unga in the 26th minute proved unexpectedly decisive.In the other match Friday, New South Wales beat the Fijian Drua 38-14, the second win this season for the Waratahs over one of the competition’s new sides.The Highlanders spent much of the second half and almost all of the final quarter on attack. But they were unable to break down the resolute Crusaders’ defense which refused to yield even when replacement hooker Shilo Klein was shown a red card in 77th minute for a shoulder charge which struck the head of Highlanders prop Ethan de Groot.ADVERTISEMENTThe Crusaders showed a remarkable ability to hold out under concerted pressure and to win crucial turnovers at the tackled ball through players such as flanker Ethan Blackadder and winger Sevu Reece.“It was a heck of a battle,” Crusaders captain Scott Barrett said. “The conditions forced both teams into playing that pressure game and it was a real see-saw right to the final whistle.”RugbyFloods force Fiji Drua to relocate; coach out with COVID-19Blues beat Moana Pasifika 32-19 in Super Rugby PacificSpain's place in 2023 Rugby World Cup in doubtCron signs 2-year deal to coach Western ForceThe first half had all the action the second half lacked. The Highlanders twice were in front and on both occasions the Crusaders were able to reply.“I was really proud of our effort,” Highlanders captain Aaron Smith said. “We were able to stay in the game for 80 minutes and put the best team in the competition under a lot of pressure.”The Highlanders remain without a win after six matches while the Crusaders have five wins from six games.Wallabies captain Michael Hooper made his return to the Waratahs after an absence of nearly two years, scoring one of six tries by the winners after coming on in the second half. The 30-year-old Hooper played club rugby in Japan in 2021.The Drua spent 30 minutes playing a man short after captain Nemani Nagusa was red-carded for a late and high tackle on Tane Edmed. Then halfback Frank Lomani received a yellow for a third illegal tackle.The Waratahs punished the Drua immediately after both dismissals, piling on 24 points in the influential duo’s absence.The Drua had two setbacks ahead of their match against the Waratahs, with flooding forcing them to evacuate their Australian training base, and head coach Mick Byrne testing positive for COVID-19.The Drua had to shift earlier this week from Lennox Head in northern New South Wales state to the Gold Coast, where Friday’s match was played.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
