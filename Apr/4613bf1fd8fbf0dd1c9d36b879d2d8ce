PHOENIX (AP) — A leading Arizona provider of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing says a lack of federal funding has forced it to drop dozens of testing sites and is no longer providing free tests to uninsured people.People without insurance will have to pay a $100 fee for COVID-19 testing and testing has been suspended at 60 of Embry Health’s Arizona sites, the company said in recent announcements.“Embry was paying for the uninsured to get tests after the government funding stopped on March 22, 2022, but as of April 2nd, can no longer afford to do so,” the company said.The company said it was urging Congress to provide additional funding for COVID-19 testing.“If people do not have free COVID-19 testing available, they will not get tested, putting families and loved ones at risk,” the company said.Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked a Democratic attempt to begin debate on a $10 billion COVID-19 compromise because the GOP wants to force a showdown vote on immigration restrictions.Biden administration officials have said the government has run out of money to finance COVID-19 testing and treatments for people without insurance, and is running low on money for boosters, free monoclonal antibody treatments and care for people with immune system weaknesses.
