BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia were mostly higher Monday as gains carried over from an upbeat finish last week on Wall Street. Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul advanced while Shanghai was closed for a holiday. Oil prices nudged higher and U.S. futures were nearly unchanged. Analysts said a healthy report Friday on the U.S. jobs market  eased worries over the recovery from the pandemic, though it also reinforced the likelihood of more interest rate hikes. Shares in Hong Kong-traded Chinese companies rose after regulators in Beijing revised rules  regarding access of overseas regulators to their audits of companies that have shares listed in overseas markets. The Chinese financial magazine Caixin reported that China proposed the revisions of rules restricting sharing of financial data of offshore-traded companies to help resolving a longstanding dispute with the U.S. that could result in more than 200 Chinese stocks being kicked off American exchanges. It would remove a requirement that on-site inspections of overseas-traded Chinese companies mainly be conducted by Chinese regulators, Caixin said.

The Fed has already raised its key overnight rate once, the first such increase since 2018. Following Friday’s jobs report, traders increased bets that the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting by double the usual amount. In the bond market, the yield on the two-year Treasury approached its highest level in more than three years, leaping to 2.45% from 2.28% late Thursday. The two-year yield again surpassed the 10-year yield, which was also climbing, but not as quickly. It topped the 10-year yield last week for the first time since 2019. That’s considered a potential omen of a recession, but it’s not a perfect indicator. Some economists say markets may be distorted by extraordinary measures taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to keep interest rates low. As of early Monday, the 10-year yield was at 2.42%, up from 2.38% on Friday. Oil and gas prices have been rising as demand recovers from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a major oil and gas producer, has raised the risk that sanctions and export restrictions might crimp supplies.A barrel of U.S. crude oil gained46 cents to $99.73 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange early Monday. It dipped 1% on Friday to $99.27. Early last month, when disruptions to crude supplies were at their height, it briefly touched $130. Brent crude, the international standard for pricing, picked up 59 cents to $104.98 per barrel. In currency dealings, the dollar bought 122.72 Japanese yen, up from 122.61 late Friday.
