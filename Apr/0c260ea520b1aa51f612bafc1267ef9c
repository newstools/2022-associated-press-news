TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Conservative Republican lawmakers have approved a measure that would prohibit Kansas or its cities, counties or school districts from imposing mask mandates to control the spread of any infectious disease.But the measure’s supporters fell far short early Friday of the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers to override a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. She has not said what she will do.The vote in the Senate was 23-17, leaving supporters four short of a two-thirds majority. The tally in the House was 64-53, leaving the bill’s backers 20 votes shy of a two-thirds majority.ADVERTISEMENTThe bill represents a response from conservative Republicans to mask mandates imposed by Kelly and cities, counties and school districts throughout the coronavirus pandemic. GOP lawmakers have over time whittled away the power of the governor and state officials to impose such mandates or restrict businesses or public gatherings during disease outbreaks.COVID-19FDA sets June meetings on COVID vaccines for youngest kidsRacial split on COVID-19 endures as restrictions ease in USPolitical stakes high as Beijing responds to virus outbreak South Africa's latest COVID surge blamed on omicron mutantLawmakers supporting the measure argued that the coronavirus pandemic showed the need to protect people’s personal liberties.
