WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The Crusaders clung to a three-point lead for 33 minutes to beat the Hurricanes 24-21 Saturday in a match of seven lead changes in Super Rugby Pacific.Elsewhere, leaders ACT Brumbies powered past the Fijian Drua 33-12 while the Blues crushed the Chiefs 25-0.There were six lead changes alone in the first half of the Crusaders’ win and only two scoring plays in the second which outweighed the first for drama.The excitement persisted until the last minute when the Hurricanes had a penalty which would have allowed them to level the match at 24-24 and take it to golden-point extra time. They chose instead to kick for touch in the hope of a match-winning try.The Crusaders contested the lineout in the air and managed to wrestle the ball from the Hurricanes in what seemed an obvious penalty offense. But the referee instead found a knock-on by the Hurricanes and blew for fulltime, leaving the Christchurch-based Crusaders with a contentious win.ADVERTISEMENT“I’m lost for words,” Hurricanes captain Ardie Savea. “We came out here and wanted to prove a point against the Crusaders who are the best team in this competition. Without sounding disrespectful, I’d just like the officials to demand better.”RugbyHighlanders beat Moana Pasifika in Super RugbyJapan's top rugby league remains a magnet for top playersAll Blacks bolster coaching lineup ahead of Ireland testsTom Smith, former Scotland, Lions rugby prop, dies at 50The ending was unfortunate in a match of such quality. In a highly physical contest, the teams exchanged scores throughout the first half before the Hurricanes went to the break with an 18-17 lead.The second half was full of action but low on actual scoring. Brothers Ardie and Julian Savea were superb ball-carriers for the Hurricanes but the Crusaders held out their attacks and were able to exert pressure in the Hurricanes’ territory through a dominant scrum.The Hurricanes extended their lead to 21-17 with a penalty in the fifth minute of the second spell. But the Crusaders wrested back the lead with a try to backrower Ethan Blackadder which gave them their eventual three-point margin.“I was glad we hung tight there. We worked and we just hung on,” Crusaders captain Scott Barrett said.Later, flyhalf Beauden Barrett helped set up two tries for backrower Tom Robinson and one for replacement A.J. Lam as the Auckland-based Blues swept past the Hamilton-based Chiefs.Robinson scored in the 16th minute and again in the 53rd to help the Blues secure a dominant win.The Blues’ fifth victory from six matches this season came in spite of the fact they received three yellow cards, including two in quick succession which left them with only 13 men at the end of the first and start of the second half.In the final match of the eighth round, four tries sourced from mauls helped the Brumbies defeat the Fijian Drua in Brisbane.The Brumbies, top of the standings with seven wins from eight games, secured a late bonus point with a step-and-pass effort from Hudson Creighton putting Tom Wright through for his second try of the night.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
