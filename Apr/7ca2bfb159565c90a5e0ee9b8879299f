GIRONA, Spain (AP) — Oliver Bekker shot a 6-under 66 to take a share of the first-round lead at the Catalunya Championship on Thursday.Seeking his first European tour win, the South African made eight birdies and a double bogey at the Stadium Course to finish tied with Jeff Winther and Darren Fichardt.“Pretty happy,” the 37-year-old Bekker said. “It’s tricky out there, it’s a tough golf course. You just keep your head down and try to hit a good shot every time you step up to hit it. It punishes you if hit it off line out here. You can never relax, that’s the thing around this golf course.”Winther had one bogey and seven birdies, while Fichardt made eight birdies to go along with a double bogey.Among those a shot back in a tie for fourth was James Morrison, who was 1-over par on the front nine but rallied with six birdies on his last nine holes. Sebastian Heisele and Haotong Li also shot 67s.ADVERTISEMENTRichard Bland, 49th in the world ranking, is the only top-50 player participating.
