TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gas prices declined again in New Jersey and around the nation amid plans for the release of more oil from the federal Strategic Petroleum Reserve. AAA Mid-Atlantic says the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.12, down six cents from last week. Drivers were paying $2.90 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $4.13, down eight cents from last week. Drivers were paying $2.87 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.Analysts say the pressure for oil prices to rise during Russia’s war in Ukraine “is meeting stronger downward pressure” from the planned release of oil from the strategic reserve as well as increased COVID-19 fears in China. They say a dip in domestic demand for the third straight week in defiance of seasonal trends may be due to higher prices at the pump and consumers altering their driving habits.
