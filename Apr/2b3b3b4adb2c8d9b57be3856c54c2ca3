One deputy fired one shot, Wednesday’s news release said.“One AK-47 style firearm and one 9mm handgun were recovered from the scene,” it said.Williams was a passenger in the car, which had run into a marsh. The driver was ticketed for reckless driving, the statement said.Police said they cannot release further details because they’re still investigating. Findings will be turned over to the parish district attorney’s office.
