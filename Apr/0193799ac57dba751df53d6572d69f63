THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Trains operated by the national rail network were halted across the Netherlands Sunday by what the operator called a technical problem.Erik Kroeze, a spokesman for railway operator NS, said the problem was in a planning software system. He said there were no indications it was caused by a cyberattack.NS said trains would be halted until 5 p.m. while it sought to fix the problem.“We are working hard on recovery, but unfortunately it is not yet possible to say how long this situation will last,” NS said in a statement on its website.Regional trains run by other operators were still running, NS said.
