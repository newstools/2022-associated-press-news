The video shows a black SUV drive by Ray’s group, and shots were fired from at least one of its windows, wounding Ray. He died a short time later at a nearby hospital.“Kelvin Joseph did not shoot Cameron Ray,” Barry Sorrels, Joseph’s attorney, said in a statement Friday. “Mr. Ray’s death is a tragedy, and Kelvin extends his deepest condolences for the family’s loss.”Joseph “was unarmed and was not looking for violence,” Sorrels said. “He found himself in a situation that escalated without his knowledge or consent. Along with condolences to the Ray family, Kelvin apologizes to the Dallas community for being anywhere near this type of incident.”ADVERTISEMENTDallas CowboysAttorney: Cowboys player in SUV from which man was shotGary Brown, former running back and coach, dies at 52Hall of Fame five-time Super Bowl OT Rayfield Wright diesSaints adding defensive end Charlton, defensive back EvansA Dallas police spokesman declined to confirm Joseph’s involvement in the case, but The Dallas Morning News reported police detectives interviewed the 22-year-old player Friday.The Cowboys took the former LSU and Kentucky star in the second round of last year’s NFL draft.In a statement, Cowboys officials said they were aware “of the tragic incident.”“The organization is aware of Kelvin Joseph’s possible connection to this incident.
