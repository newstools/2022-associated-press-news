IMOLA, Italy (AP) — Carlos Sainz Jr. signed a new contract with Ferrari on Thursday until 2024, ahead of the Italian team’s home Formula One race this weekend.Sainz joined Ferrari from McLaren in 2021 on a two-year contract.“I have always said that there is no better Formula One team to race for and after over a year with them, I can confirm that putting on this race suit and representing this team is unique and incomparable,” Sainz said. “My first season at Maranello was solid and constructive, with the whole group progressing together. The result of all that work has been clear to see so far season.”Ferrari leads the constructors’ championship after two wins for Sainz’s teammate, Charles Leclerc, in the opening three races. Sainz, who has never won an F1 race, finished second in Bahrain and third in Saudi Arabia but the Spanish driver crashed out of the last grand prix in Australia.ADVERTISEMENTThe 27-year-old Sainz is third in the drivers’ standings, 38 points behind Leclerc and four below George Russell.“I feel strengthened by this renewed show of confidence in me and now I can’t wait to get in the car, to do my best for Ferrari and to give its fans plenty to cheer about,” Sainz added.
