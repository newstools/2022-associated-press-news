BOSTON (AP) — The University of Massachusetts, under financial pressure because of high inflation and other expected cost increases, is raising tuition across the board this fall for the first time in three years.Trustees on Wednesday voted to increase in-state, undergraduate tuition by 2.5% for the 2022-2023 academic year, which would add $395 to the bill of a student at the flagship Amherst campus, and slightly less at the Boston, Dartmouth and Lowell campuses, the system announced.Out-of-state undergraduates face the same increases, except at Amherst where they face a 3% hike. Room and board costs are also rising by up to 3.9%.The system had not raised tuition during the COVID-19 pandemic.“These student charge adjustments are necessary to sustain the academic excellence at each UMass campus, and provide students with the facilities and services they need and deserve,” the system said in a statement. “They follow two years of tuition freezes, remain far below the rate of inflation, and do not reflect the record-breaking grant aid ($373 million this year) that the university provides students.”ADVERTISEMENTGraduate student tuition is also on the rise, except at the Dartmouth campus where no increases are planned.COVID-19Anti-virus shutdowns in China spread as infections risePfizer to seek COVID booster for healthy 5- to 11-year-oldsWHO: COVID cases, deaths in Africa drop to lowest levels yetBangladesh, Nepal celebrate new years after pandemic pause Tuition at the system’s UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester is also going up 2.5%, while tuition at UMass Law is jumping by as much as 2.9%.The university said it is facing projected inflation of 8.5%, an increased fringe benefit assessment, and mental health and COVID-19 service expansions.The university has about 75,000 students across five campuses.
