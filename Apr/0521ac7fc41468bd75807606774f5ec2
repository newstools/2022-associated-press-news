COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The South Carolina House will be on spring break this week.Speaker Jay Lucas is continuing his tradition of allowing the chamber to have a week off leading into Easter. This year, the House also took a week off in March after Lucas said members worked hard and passed enough bills.House members passed a flurry of bills last week just before the key crossover deadline where any bill that doesn’t pass the House or Senate before that date will need a two-thirds vote to be considered by the other chamber.There will be 12 days left in the General Assembly’s regular session when the House returns on April 19.The Senate will be in session with the Finance Committee considering the state’s nearly $14 billion budget.
