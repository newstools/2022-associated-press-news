Players who go on the restricted list because they are unvaccinated against COVID-19 do not get paid and do not accrue major league service time.Catcher Kevin Plawecki rejoined the team Monday after missing seven games while on the COVID-19 injured list, but has not yet been added to the roster.Red Sox manager Alex Cora has missed the past four games after being infected with COVID-19. Boston infielder Jonathan Araúz has been on the COVID-19 IL since April 19.The Red Sox recalled right-hander Tyler Danish from Triple-A Providence and selected righty John Schreiber from Triple-A.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
