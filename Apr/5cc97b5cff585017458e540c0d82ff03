LOS ANGELES (AP) — A train engineer who intentionally derailed a locomotive near a U.S. Navy hospital ship that was deployed in Los Angeles harbor to help during the COVID-19 pandemic was sentenced Wednesday to three years in prison, prosecutors said.Eduardo Moreno was also ordered to pay more than $755,000 in restitution, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a statement. Moreno, 46, pleaded guilty in December 2021 to one count of committing a terrorist attack. Moreno, who worked at the Port of Los Angeles, acknowledged in his plea agreement that on March 31, 2020, he drove a locomotive at full speed off the end of the tracks near where the Mercy was docked because he believed it might be involved in a sinister conspiracy, prosecutors saidNobody was hurt, but the derailment caused about $755,880 in damages. The train also spilled fuel that required a hazardous-materials cleanup.ADVERTISEMENTMoreno told port police that he was suspicious of the Mercy “and believed it had an alternate purpose related to COVID-19 or a government takeover,” the U.S. attorney’s office said, citing court documents.Moreno said he knew the derailment would bring media attention, and he wanted to “wake people up,” according to an affidavit filed with the criminal complaint.COVID-19A million empty spaces: Chronicling COVID's cruel US tollEchoes of one million lost in the spaces they left behindCDC extends travel mask requirement to May 3 as COVID rises A million empty spaces: Chronicling COVID's ruthless US tollThe train smashed through concrete, steel and chain-link barriers and slid through a parking lot before coming to a stop about 250 yards (228 meters) from the Mercy, officials said.Moreno said he acted alone and hadn’t planned the derailment in advance, prosecutors said.The 1,000-bed Mercy, based at Naval Base San Diego, docked at the Port of Los Angeles in March 2020 to accept non-coronavirus patients to prevent local hospitals from being overwhelmed as cases surged.However, the initial rise in hospitalizations wasn’t as severe as expected. The Mercy’s crew treated about 80 people before departing in mid-May.
