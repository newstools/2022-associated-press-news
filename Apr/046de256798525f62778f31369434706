PHILADELPHIA (AP) — New York Mets right-hander Taijuan Walker was put on the 10-day injured list Tuesday because of bursitis in his pitching shoulder, the latest setback to the team’s rotation.Walker received a cortisone shot. He threw two perfect innings Monday night at Philadelphia in his season debut, then was pulled after 30 pitches. He was replaced by left-hander David Peterson, who is likely to fill in for Walker in the rotation.Walker was 7-11 with a 4.47 ERA last season, his first with the Mets, and was picked for the NL All-Star team. A strong first half was followed by a terrible second half, and he had a clean-up procedure on his knee in the offseason.The knee gave him a little trouble late in spring training, but he was able to take his turn the first time through the rotation. The Mets already were missing two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom. He was sidelined before opening day because of a stress reaction that caused inflammation around his shoulder blade, a problem that could keep him from pitching in the majors until June.ADVERTISEMENTThree-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer is set to pitch Wednesday against the Phillies. He had a hamstring issue during spring training, but was able to start last weekend at Washington.In other roster moves, the Mets activated closer Edwin Díaz from the bereavement list and sent right-hander Yennsy Díaz outright to Triple-A Syracuse. ___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
