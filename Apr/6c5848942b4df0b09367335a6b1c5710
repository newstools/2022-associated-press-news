OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — One of Oakland’s all-time greats is still waiting for the number retirement ceremony he was promised.Right-hander Dave Stewart, now 65, found out in August 2019 the club planned to retire his No. 34 jersey, then it didn’t happen during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season or last year. The former World Series MVP and four-time 20-game winner posted on his Twitter account this week some apparent frustration with his hometown team. “I have no idea what the A’s are doing. At this point they can just retire the number with no celebration as far as I’m concerned,” Stewart wrote. “Come to the park and it will be on display with the other retired numbers. If you find out something before I do, please let me know?”The A’s said they plan to announce next week during the club’s season-opening homestand a date to honor Stewart but hadn’t done so previously because the schedule was in flux with the lockout. Oakland also wants to bring in some other former players to help celebrate.
