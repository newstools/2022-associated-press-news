TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Home and apartment-building owners will get a small break in the property taxes they’ll owe this year and are likely to see small decreases in future years under a measure Gov. Laura Kelly signed into law Thursday.The legislation includes a grab-bag of changes expected to cut taxes by $310 million over the next three years. The biggest piece of the savings, about $134 million over three years, goes to owners of residential property.To help fund public schools, the state imposes a tax of $2.30 for every $1,000 of a residential property’s value as determined by the county appraiser, but it exempts the first $20,000 from the levy. The measure Kelly signed increases the exemption to $40,000 for this year, saving the owners of any residential property worth that much or more $46 a year. ADVERTISEMENTThe state will be required to adjust the exemption annually based on the 10-year average percentage for how much the value of all the state’s residential property increases. The exemption is likely to inch up steadily.BusinessEXPLAINER: What is Musk really doing as he guns for Twitter?Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter, make it 'maximally trusted'IMF chief: Ukraine war and inflation threaten global economyUS jobless claims rise but remain near a half-century lowThe Republican-controlled Legislature is considering other tax cuts worth roughly $1.2 billion  over three years.
