MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich. (AP) — Central Michigan University is defending its decision to eliminate the men’s track team, saying it was a financial move and not a discriminatory step.The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights informed CMU this week that it had received a complaint. The government said it will remain neutral while collecting and analyzing evidence.CMU said in 2020 that it was dropping the track team. It subsequently added a men’s golf team.The 2019-20 track team had 30 athletes, including six who were Black or identified as multi-racial, CMU said.“I firmly believe the investigation will find no evidence to support claims of racial discrimination, which are inaccurate and misleading,” President Bob Davies said.CMU said the track team cost $1 million a year while golf will be half that amount, the Morning Sun reported.
