She chose my life,” Reichenbach said.His adopted parents are white, and Reichenbach said that’s an important part of his story too.He thanked “my sister, who in the 1970s put me on her hip and walked me into that all-white high school and dared somebody to challenge her and her little brother.”Reichenbach said he wants to help people who are struggling with rising energy prices and grocery prices.“Acknowledging we will not all see eye to eye on each issue, on each solution, I am certain we can have respectful discourse and come together to prioritize problem solving,” Reichenbach said.___Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP.
