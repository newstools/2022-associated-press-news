BOSTON (AP) — Red Sox catcher Christian Vázquez and infielder Jonathan Araúz have been added to the COVID-19 related injury list. The team announced their additions on Tuesday, a day after catcher Kevin Plawecki and two staffers tested positive for the virus. Right-handed pitcher Tyler Danish was recalled from Worcester and Boston selected the contract of outfielder Rob Refsnyder from the Triple-A farm team to take their places on the roster. Boston opened a three-game series against Toronto on Tuesday night. After Sunday’s 8-1 victory over the Twins, Red Sox manager Alex Cora said Boston expected to be without multiple unvaccinated players for an upcoming series at Toronto. Starting pitcher Tanner Houck told the Boston Globe on Sunday that he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 and won’t pitch during the four-game series beginning April 25. He would have been in line to start the second game.ADVERTISEMENTTo enter Canada, the Canadian government requires a person must have received a second COVID-19 vaccine dose — or one dose of Johnson & Johnson — at least 14 days prior to entry.Players sidelined by COVID-19 vaccine issues are not paid and do not accrue major league service time while on the restricted list.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
