IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Iowa men’s basketball player Austin Ash has entered the transfer portal and will take advantage of the bonus year of eligibility granted to athletes who were on rosters during the COVID-19 pandemic.“I couldn’t be more grateful for my time at the University of Iowa,” Ash said in a statement Wednesday. “I can’t thank Coach (Fran) McCaffery and the other coaches enough for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to be Hawkeye. Raising the Big Ten trophy in Indianapolis with my teammates is a memory that I will never forget.” Ash was a walk-on his first four seasons, including redshirting as a true freshman in 2017-18, before earning a scholarship prior to the 2021-22 season. The native of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, appeared in a total of 44 games over four seasons. He averaged 2.6 per game in 18 appearances this past season.
