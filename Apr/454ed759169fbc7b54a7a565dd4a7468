HONOLULU (AP) — Officials in Hawaii are expected to vote Wednesday on a new law that would require short-term rental owners on Oahu to limit tenant stays to a minimum of three months. The Honolulu City Council is weighing the measure which was introduced at the request of Mayor Rick Blangiardi, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The current minimum stay for short-term rentals is 30 days. With a few exceptions, the measure would also limit short-term rentals to resort-zoned areas, including parts of Waikiki. The bill was amended in March to prohibit on-street parking for guests in vacation rentals in communities zoned as rural, residential or apartment use.Rental companies like AirBnB have urged officials to honor a current agreement that allows for a lottery to win vacation rental permits in some residential areas. ADVERTISEMENTThe debate over short-terms rentals is divided. “Short-term rentals are disruptive to the character and fabric of our residential neighborhoods,” said Thomas Cestare of the Lanikai Association in written testimony.
