Egypt lost to Senegal on penalties Tuesday after Sadio Mané converted the winner.Salah was targeted by laser pointers before missing his kick in the shootout.“I’m obviously really happy for Sadio that he could make it and I’m obviously very disappointed and feel (for) Mo,” Klopp said. “I don’t think that the situation around with the penalty and the laser(s) was particularly cool. That’s clear as well. So, I feel for him, but I’m happy for Sadio as well. That’s football.“Senegal is probably in the moment the best team in Africa,” he added. “Egypt did really well. I’m not sure they can see it like this exactly but my point of view is they should.”Senegal’s victory was similar to the African Cup of Nations final when Mané clinched a first major title for his country by also scoring the winning penalty in a shootout against the Egyptians.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
