MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The Memphis Grizzlies responded to losing their first game as a No. 2 seed by getting back to how they play. The result? The largest margin of victory in franchise history in a playoff game and a near triple-double by Ja Morant.The All-Star point guard scored 23 points, handed out 10 assists and grabbed nine rebounds as the Grizzlies looked much more like the team that posted the NBA’s second-best record, routing the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-96 on Tuesday night to even up their first-round Western Conference series at 1 apiece.

But the win is the important thing, and we got that.”ADVERTISEMENTMemphis coach Taylor Jenkins said Morant showed great balance along with the bench outscoring Minnesota 60-43 and defense fueling the offense. “This is our recipe ...,” Jenkins said. “This is the more the style that we got to play.” NBABubble Jimmy, or a new version, back at right time for HeatAP SportlightGolden State visits Denver with 2-0 series leadJazz, Mavericks square off with series tied 1-1Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. each added 16 with Jackson hitting 4 of 7 from 3-point range.

This time, officials stayed very busy calling 20 fouls in a very long first quarter. That kept the NBA’s top scoring teams in the regular season from getting into any rhythm as they combined to shoot 33 free throws. Foul trouble forced Jenkins to turn to Tillman who didn’t play in Game 1, and he turned in the best playoff game of his young career. The Grizzlies grabbed their biggest lead of this short series at 30-23 on a floater by Jones with 2:11 left, and they led 33-32 after the first quarter when Morant’s long buzzer-beater attempt hit off the rim and off. ADVERTISEMENT“Then our offense just dried up. Our shot selection in the second quarter basically started the avalanche,” said Minnesota coach Chris Finch, who added that the Grizzlies also started controlling the glass. “That’s really where the game was won.”The Grizzlies shot 48% from the floor compared to 40% for Minnesota. Both teams made 11 3s, a big difference from the series opener when Minnesota knocked down 16 of 41 compared to 7 of 27 for Memphis.Memphis started running in the second and opened the quarter with an 11-2 run and finished on an 11-5 run for a 60-49 lead at halftime with Morant not scoring a point. Patrick Beverley summed up Minnesota’s struggles when his layup before the buzzer rolled off the rim.
