A 16-year-old student faces sex assault and attempted murder charges in the incident.Escalating violence, including fights, assaults and brawls, in the districthas prompted frustration among teachers, public safety officials and others.“This cannot wait one more day,” Clark County Education Association President Marie Neisess said. “We must act now.”ADVERTISEMENT“We have seen not an increase of calls, but an increase of the violence, a lack of empathy, and a lack of respect to our adult authority,” said Brigid Duffy, juvenile division director of the county District Attorney’s Office.The sprawling district, the nation’s fifth-largest, has more than 300,000 students and 18,000 teachers at about 336 campuses.
