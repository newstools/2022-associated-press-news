O’FALLON, Mo. (AP) — Prosecutors won’t bring charges against two suburban St. Louis police officers who fatally shot a teenager inside a car. St. Charles County Prosecutor Timothy Lohmar said in a letter to the O’Fallon officers’ police chief that the officers believed their lives and the community’s safety were at risk when they fatally shot 17-year-old Christopher Jones  in January, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Police said Jones and a passenger were asleep in a stolen car parked in an O’Fallon cul-de-sac when the officers approached the vehicle and ordered them to open the locked doors. Police on Thursday released body camera video of the encounter, showing Officer Matthew Vegovisch approaching the driver’s side with his gun drawn and ordering Jones to open the door. When Jones failed to do so immediately, Vegovisch smashed the window with his gun.ADVERTISEMENTBusinessA key inflation gauge jumped 6.6% in March, most since 1982Musk sells $4B in Tesla shares, presumably for Twitter dealStocks fall on Wall Street, sinking indexes for the weekExxon profits surge despite $3.4B hit from Russian exitJones then backed into the officers’ squad car and sped off, and Vegovisch and Officer Michael Manzella fired multiple shots into the car, hitting Jones twice.
