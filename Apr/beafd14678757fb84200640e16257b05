CHICAGO (AP) — Whenever Alec Mills makes it back to the Chicago Cubs, he plans to be ready for whatever manager David Ross needs from him.Mills is rehabbing a low back strain that landed him on the 10-day injured list on opening day. The veteran right-hander pitched three innings in a rehab start with Triple-A Iowa on Saturday, allowing three runs and eight hits.He is expected to make another rehab start with Iowa on Thursday or Friday.“I feel good. I obviously need to get to a position where I can throw multiple innings,” Mills said. “So go out there and get another outing under my belt and feel good again, see where we go from there.”The 30-year-old Mills set career highs with 32 appearances and 20 starts for Chicago last year, finishing with a 6-7 record and a 5.07 ERA. He said he is up for whatever is needed when he comes off the IL.“I’m building up to start games, but whatever happens when I get back is what I’ll do,” he said.ADVERTISEMENTThe Cubs also have left-hander Wade Miley on the IL with elbow inflammation. Miley threw about 50 pitches in a bullpen session on Saturday, and he is expected to throw a live BP on Wednesday.

But he left open the possibility for changes depending on injuries and other factors.“The true direction is to start Wade, and I think the true direction for me would be to start Millsy as well,” Ross said. “That’s how he’s building up.”___Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
