CLEVELAND (AP) — Deshaun Watson walked through snow on the way to his first day of work with the Browns. Baker Mayfield was nowhere in sight.Watson reported to Cleveland’s offseason program Tuesday to restart his career with the Browns, who mortgaged their short-term future by acquiring the controversial quarterback accused of sexual misconduct in a trade last month.With temperatures in the 30s and late-spring snow falling, the former Houston QB arrived at the team’s facility in Berea, Ohio. The Browns posted a photo on Twitter of Watson, wearing a heavy winter jacket, before he entered the building.One of the reasons the three-time Pro Bowler and South Carolina native initially turned down the Browns in their pursuit before changing his mind was because of Northeast Ohio’s frigid, wintry weather.ADVERTISEMENTWatson lost the one game he played in Cleveland with the Texans as howling winds made it almost impossible to throw. He’ll have months to acclimate.The Browns convinced Watson to join him and then traded three first-round draft picks and six selections overall in March to Houston for the 26-year-old, who faces 22 civil lawsuits from women accusing him of sexual misconduct during massage therapy sessions.NFLDeshaun Watson reports to Browns for first offseason programDivision II star emerges among NFL's small-school prospectsMonday Sports in BriefBrowns speak to NFL on 'tanking' claims made by former coachBrowns coach Kevin Stefanski is scheduled to meet with reporters Wednesday.
