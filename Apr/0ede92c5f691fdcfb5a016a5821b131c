BANGOR, Maine (AP) — Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday just hours after voting to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court, her office said.Collins’ office said the veteran senator, in office since 1997, tested positive late in the afternoon, a couple of hours after the historic vote. She wore a mask while on the Senate floor, her office said. Collins, 69, was experiencing mild symptoms and will “isolate and work remotely in accordance with CDC guidelines,” her office said. The only member of Maine’s four-member congressional delegation who has not tested positive for COVID-19 at some point is Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden tested positive last month, and independent Sen. Angus King tested positive last year.
