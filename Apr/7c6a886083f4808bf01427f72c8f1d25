DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) — The Dunedin-based Highlanders ended a six-match losing streak at the start of the Super Rugby Pacific season Friday with a 35-17 over Moana Pasifika.Starting hooker Andrew Makalio scored a try and Rhys Marshall — Makalio’s early replacement — added two more as the Highlanders scored several tries from lineouts.In total, the Highlanders scored six tries to Moana Pasifika’s two to take a bonus point from their first home win since June 2021.Moana Pasifika was punished 16-5 in the penalty count and conceded the first seven penalties of the second half as the Highlanders took control after leading 17-10 at halftime. In addition, they had two players sent to the sin bin, one in each half.The Highlanders were able to take charge of the match with a kicking game which gave them field position and strong forward play which allowed them to profit from set pieces. Their scrum won repeated penalties and their lineout set the platform for rolling mauls which led to tries.ADVERTISEMENT“We had a real plan about our forwards having a big game tonight and they were outstanding,” Highlanders captain Aaron Smith said. “They stayed in the fight and got us that win.RugbyJapan's top rugby league remains a magnet for top playersAll Blacks bolster coaching lineup ahead of Ireland testsTom Smith, former Scotland, Lions rugby prop, dies at 50England to play 3-test rugby series in Australia in July“The backs wanted to back them up through our kicking plan but the forwards really rolled their sleeves up, went to the trenches and it was outstanding.”The first half was closely contested and Moana Pasifika was able to hit back when the Highlanders scored, keeping the score close.The Highlanders’ first try came after only three minutes and from an attacking lineout.
