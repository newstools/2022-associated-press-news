The officers were not hit by gunfire, although one officer was taken to a hospital for treatment of a medical issue after the shooting.

Police said the younger Hogans was the same man who fired on police Wednesday night.Northwoods is located about 6 miles (9.7 kilometers) northwest of St. Louis.___This story has been corrected to correct the elder victim’s last name to “Hogans.” Police initially reported his name as “Hogan.”
