DENVER (AP) — The Denver suburb where police officers and paramedics have been charged in the death of a Black man in 2019  ousted its police chief Wednesday, nearly two years after she took over vowing to rebuild community relations and reform the department.In a press release, Aurora’s city manager implied that while Vanessa Wilson prioritized community involvement, she didn’t effectively manage the police department.“To provide the level of public safety that our community deserves, a change in leadership must occur,” Jim Twombly said.Wilson’s firing followed the release Tuesday of a city-commissioned independent audit that found that the police department in Colorado’s third-largest city had failed to eliminate a backlog of thousands of crime reports -- a backlog that could delay investigations and arrests. It came amid an effort to oust Wilson by some conservative city council members and police union members who objected to Wilson’s reform efforts,  Sentinel Colorado reported.BusinessEXPLAINER: What Elon Musk at Twitter might mean for usersMiami’s crypto craze on full display at bitcoin conferenceDemocrats accuse oil companies of 'rip off' on gas pricesChanel restricts sales to Russians abroad amid Ukraine warADVERTISEMENTWilson became chief in 2020 after the 2019 death of Elijah McClain gained new attention amid protests over police brutality and racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd.
