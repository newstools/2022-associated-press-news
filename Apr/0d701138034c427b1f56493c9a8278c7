The letter’s contents were first reported Tuesday by SNY and the letter was obtained by The Associated Press.MLB has said the fine was for violating rules on the use of the dugout phone but made the distinction that the Yankees did not use electronics to steal signs, a greater violation that led in January 2020 to the Houston Astros getting fined $5 million and resulted in one-year suspensions for Astros manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow, who were both fired for the team’s conduct during the 2017 season. WOMEN’S SOCCERHOUSTON (AP) — The Houston Dash suspended general manager and head coach James Clarkson on Tuesday after the team received a report on a joint investigation by the National Women’s Soccer League and its players’ association into alleged discrimination, harassment and abuse. The team announced the suspension, which was recommended by the league and NWSLPA. Houston also said that an “ultimate decision” about Clarkson’s future as a leader and coach will be “based on the final results of an ongoing investigation.”ADVERTISEMENTThe Houston Dash are the latest NWSL team to deal with reports of discrimination and harassment. In 2021, several coaches resigned or were fired due to abuse or harassment issues, and NY/NJ Gotham FC fired its general manager. Also last year, the league investigated, but didn’t take action against the Dash after a Black player for the Chicago Red Stars said a security guard in Houston treated her and her boyfriend inappropriately because of their race.TENNISRafael Nadal will play the Madrid Open after recovering from a rib injury that sidelined him for a month, the Spaniard said Tuesday.Nadal had been recovering from a stress fracture he sustained while playing at Indian Wells in March.
