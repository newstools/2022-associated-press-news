HONOLULU (AP) — Federal authorities have begun monitoring Hawaii wastewater for COVID-19, while the state expects its own monitoring program to be fully operational this summer, officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been testing in the islands as part of its National Wastewater Surveillance System, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The agency posts wastewater data on its COVID Data Tracker website, denoted by dots on a U.S. map. Data from Hawaii hasn’t been included yet due to “a technical glitch being resolved with how the points are displayed on the map,” said CDC spokesperson Nick Spinelli.The agency said it would also display data from the Hawaii Department of Health once the state is able to submit its own figures.ADVERTISEMENTMore than 30 states have been funded to participate in the CDC program, but some are still getting their collection efforts up and running.Several issues delayed Hawaii’s early plans to set up its own statewide monitoring program.COVID-19Shanghai reports first deaths in current COVID-19 outbreakAgencies monitoring Hawaii wastewater for COVID-19Migrant crossings spike as US plans to lift curb on asylum Florida judge voids US mask mandate for planes, other travelThe state faced a six-month wait for shipment of sample-collection machines, which were back-ordered due to high demand.
