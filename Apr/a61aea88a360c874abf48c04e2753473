WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — A Kansas father who reportedly played video games after fatally injuring one of his twin infant childre n has been sentenced to more than 26 years in prison. Marlin Williams Jr., 25, was sentenced Thursday to 316 months in prison, television station KAKE reported. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to second-degree murder in the January 2020 death of his 2-month-old son, Marrell, and to three counts of aggravated battery for abusing the baby and his twin sister. Williams, who is 6-foot-2 and was about 400 pounds at the time, told police he was frustrated with the infants’ crying and squeezed his son’s head “extra hard” before leaving the room to go play video games for around a half-hour. When he later checked on the baby, the infant vomited, and Williams contacted a friend, who told him to call 911.Doctors later found that Marrell had suffered two skull fractures and that his twin sister had suffered a broken femur. The boy died six days later. The girl is now 2 years old.
