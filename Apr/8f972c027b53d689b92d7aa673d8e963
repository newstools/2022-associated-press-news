OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The second-degree murder conviction of former Oklahoma police officer who fatally shot a man who was threatening to set fire to himself has been upheld. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals on Thursday rejected 25 claims by former Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Keith Patrick Sweeney.Sweeney’s arguments included that he was not allowed to call an expert in shootings by police as a witness, improper testimony by prosecution witnesses, and improper evidence of body camera footage and photographs of the victim.A defense attorney did not immediately return a phone call for comment.Sweeney was convicted in 2019 and sentenced to 10 years in prison for the 2017 fatal shooting of 29-year-old Dustin Pigeon. Sweeney was among several officers responding to reports of a suicidal person and found Pigeon doused in lighter fluid, holding a lighter, and threatening to set himself on fire in southwest Oklahoma City. Prosecutors said Sweeney shot Pigeon after another officer fired a bean bag at Pigeon and two officers on the scene testified that Pigeon posed no threat.Defense attorneys argued that Sweeney believed Pigeon was holding a knife.
