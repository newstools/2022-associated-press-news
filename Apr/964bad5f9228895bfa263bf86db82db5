Mark Giordano added a goal and an assist and John Tavares and Timothy Liljegren also scored Toronto, which got 20 saves from Erik Kallgren. Mitch Marner added three assists.Nikolaj Ehlers had a goal and an assist, Blake Wheeler and Paul Stastny also scored for Winnipeg. Eric Comrie stopped 31 shots.ADVERTISEMENTMatthews joined Andreychuk, Rick Vaive (three times) and Gary Leeman as the only Maple Leafs players to reach the half-century goal mark.Kallgren got the start with Petr Mrazek likely to be out at least six weeks with his third groin injury of the season suffered in Tuesday’s 6-4 victory over Boston. No. 1 goalie Jack Campbell (rib ailment) has been cleared medically to resume action for the first time since March 8, but didn’t dress with Toronto set to head out on a four-game road trip starting Saturday in Philadelphia.NHLMatthews NHL-leading 50th goal leads Maple Leafs past JetsMalkin scores in OT, Penguins beat Wild 4-3Andersen blanks Canadiens 4-0 as Hurricanes stay hotBruins bust out for 8-1 victory over Devils as Rask honored Trailing 2-1 after the first period, Toronto tied things up 1:58 into the second when Nylander banged a Matthews’ rebound off the end boards past Comrie for his 25th goal of the season.Ehlers scored his 21st — and seventh in the last 10 games — on a Winnipeg power play at 3:45 past a screened Kallgren.The Leafs got even at 3-all 23 seconds later when Tavares swatted his 23rd past Comrie, who got the start in place of Connor Hellebuyck in the second of a back-to-back.Nylander poked in his second of the game and 26th of the year on another man advantage at 8:40 as the Leafs’ top-ranked power play connected for Toronto’s first lead.Mikheyev made it 5-3 when took a pass from Pierre Engvall with the Leafs killing a penalty, settled the puck on his stick and scored his 15th at 13:55 for his team’s league-leading 11th short-handed goal.Winnipeg opened the scoring at 3:19 of the first when Wheeler stepped around Giordano before scoring his 12th.The Jets made it 2-0 at 7:45 when Stastny took a rebound off the end boards and fooled Kallgren on a wraparound for his 18th.Giordano made up for his earlier mistake on the Wheeler goal when his attempted pass pinged off two defenders for his seventh of the campaign — and first as a Leaf at 15:03.ADVERTISEMENTMatthews was twice robbed of 50 goals by COVID-19.
