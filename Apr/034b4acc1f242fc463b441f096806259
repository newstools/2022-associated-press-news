PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Officials at Oregon Health & Science University have apologized to employees after a fake phishing test drew complaints about raising false hopes. The university sent the phishing test email to employees on April 12 offering up to $7,500 in financial assistance, Portland television station KGW8 reported Thursday. The email, from a “benefit@ohsu.edu” address, read in part: “In response to the current community hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Oregon Health & Science University has decided to assist all employees in getting through these difficult times.” It included a link where respondents could “register” for COVID-related benefits. But the offer was not real — it was a test intended to measure employees’ cybersecurity awareness and OHSU’s own technology systems. The test was sent several days after the university sent a message to employees warning them about suspicious emails. ADVERTISEMENTThe phishing test was met with frustration from some employees.

That was a mistake,” the OHSU statement said. “The real scam was insensitive and exploitive of OHSU members — and the attempt to educate members felt the same way, causing confusion and concern.”
