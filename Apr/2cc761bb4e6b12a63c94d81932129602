HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he tested positive for the coronavirus Tuesday after experiencing mild symptoms overnight.“We’ve done the contact tracing and let people know,” the Democrat said in a Twitter post. “It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!”Murphy, in his second term in the Senate, is among several top Connecticut politicians who have contracted COVID-19 within the past month, including Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, Attorney General William Tong and Treasurer Shawn Wooden.The diagnosis also comes during a coronavirus wave in Washington that has infected White House staffers, Cabinet members and lawmakers. Vice President Kamala Harris also tested positive on Tuesday.
