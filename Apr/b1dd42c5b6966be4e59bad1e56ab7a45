CRESTWOOD, Ill. (AP) — A former suburban Chicago mayor was sentenced Monday to a year in federal prison for taking $5,000 to help a red-light camera company.Louis Presta, 72, resigned as Crestwood’s mayor in November when he  pleaded guilty to felony counts of official misconduct and other crimes.According to his plea agreement, Presta took the money in exchange for helping the company, SafeSpeed LLC, put more cameras in the southwest suburb as well as increase revenues from existing cameras by approving more violations. Presta, a Democrat first elected mayor in 2013, held back tears as he spoke to the judge, apologizing to his wife and residents.“I’m so sorry for bringing this scandal to the village of Crestwood,” he said. “I never thought that I’d be a criminal defendant.”ADVERTISEMENTU.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin said the corruption damaged Crestwood. He could have ordered a longer sentence but noted Presta’s ailing health and several letters of support.Omar Maani was an executive at SafeSpeed. He was cooperating with the FBI, and the exchange of cash was recorded on a camera.“SafeSpeed had no knowledge of this criminal conduct, and SafeSpeed certainly did not authorize it and does not condone it,” the company said.
