BOSTON (AP) — The Massachusetts state Senate has passed a bill to legalize in-person and online betting on professional sports in the state, a move that according to chamber leadership would generate $35 million in tax revenue annually.The bill passed on a voice vote late Thursday differs significantly from a sports betting bill  passed in the state House of Representatives last summer that would also allow wagers to be placed on collegiate events.Universities in the state that play NCAA Division I athletics had previously expressed opposition to college sports betting.The Senate’s version includes safeguards that address gambling addiction, such as limits on the use of a credit card to place a sports wager, limits on advertising, and the establishment by the state Department of Public Health of a compulsive gambling assistance program.ADVERTISEMENT“I am proud that the Senate has taken a thoughtful and balanced approach to legalizing sports betting,” Democratic Senate President Karen Spilka said in a statement. “This legislation is consumer-focused and responsible, while promoting economic development.”SportsDefense 1st, then offense, with receivers a focal point Plenty of tantalizing possibilities in Round 2 of NFL draftTrading post: 9 draft-day trades shake up 1st roundJags take 'athletic freak' Walker with top pick in NFL draftThe bill would allow sports betting at the state’s three existing casinos, and establishes a process to license six other businesses to offer in-person and online wagering at a retail location.
