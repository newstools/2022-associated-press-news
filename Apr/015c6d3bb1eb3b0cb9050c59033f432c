LONDON (AP) — U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu has parted ways with coach Torben Beltz six months after hiring him.The 19-year-old British player said Tuesday she’s seeking “a new training model” despite rising to a career-high ranking of No. 11 this week after reaching the quarterfinals at the Stuttgart Open.“I want to thank Torben for his coaching, professionalism and dedication over last half a year,” Raducanu said in a statement. “He has a huge heart and I have enjoyed our strong chemistry during the time together. I feel the best direction for my development is to transition to a new training model with the (British tennis federation) supporting in the interim.”Raducanu split from coach Andrew Richardson after last year’s U.S. Open — where she became the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam title — and later hired Beltz, former coach of three-time major champion Angelique Kerber, saying she wanted someone with tour experience.Raducanu is scheduled to play at the Madrid Open this week.___More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
