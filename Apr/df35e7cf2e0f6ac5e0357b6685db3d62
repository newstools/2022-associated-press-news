NEW YORK (AP) — Several dozen New York City teachers and other school employees who officials said submitted fraudulent proof of COVID-19 vaccination were placed on leave as of Monday.The United Federation of Teachers is challenging the disciplinary action, which it says violates its collective bargaining agreement. The employees in question were placed on leave after investigators determined that they had provided false vaccine cards, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said. “Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 — universal adult vaccination,” the spokesperson, Nathaniel Styer, said in a statement. “We immediately moved to put these employees — fewer than 100 — on leave without pay.”A COVID-19 vaccination mandate took effect for New York City school employees last fall and was later expanded to include all city employees.ADVERTISEMENTThe school vaccination rule was a key component of the city’s policy of opening all classrooms to in-person learning this academic year, rather than offering a remote option as some school districts did.COVID-19Most of Beijing to be tested for COVID amid lockdown worryN.
