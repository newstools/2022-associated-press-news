Phil Murphy, a Democrat. “This year’s Earth Week theme of investing in our planet is reflective of our New Jersey values as we aim to set an example for the nation.”The grant program will allow local governments, academic institutions, nonprofits and others to receive grants to restore coastal, woodland and urban ecosystems to reduce greenhouse gases.“Natural solutions are important because they have the potential to do so much more than sequester carbon,” said Katrina Angarone, a DEP associate commissioner. “Trees planted in our urban areas also help cool our cities, clean our air, provide habitat, reduce flooding and provide green spaces in highly urbanized spaces. Restored tidal wetlands provide important wildlife and fisheries habitat and can increase the resilience of our coastal areas. These projects have the potential to be a win several times over for communities on the front line of climate change.” ___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at twitter.com/WayneParryAC
