Rangers launched a helicopter to provide what they thought was urgent medical help, only to turn back after guides said the group of three was descending.One of the climbers testified he and the other climber were never suffering from shock. Instead, the charges said, Lance had insisted they stay put because the National Park Service was obligated to rescue them because they had paid a fee.The other two climbers ultimately convinced Lance to descend with them to a 17,200-foot high camp..
