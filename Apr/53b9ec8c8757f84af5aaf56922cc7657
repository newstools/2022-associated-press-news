ROME (AP) — A spectacular overhead kick from Álvaro Morata led to a stoppage-time score for Juventus to draw with nine-man Bologna 1-1 in Serie A on Saturday.Morata’s acrobatic effort was going wide until Dušan Vlahović met it with a header at the far post that found the target to salvage a point for the Bianconeri. They’d been denied a penalty in a disputed VAR decision moments earlier.Juventus remained fourth, moving within three points of third-placed Napoli, which hosts fifth-placed Roma on Monday.Marko Arnautović put Bologna ahead after the break by running onto a through ball from Roberto Soriano and rounding the goalkeeper to deposit the ball into an empty net.Bologna’s last six goals have all been by Arnautović, who has 12 this season.They are playing for ailing coach Siniša Mihajlović, who is hospitalized while being treated for the return of his leukemia.ADVERTISEMENTMorata thought he earned Juventus a late penalty when he appeared to be fouled inside the area by Adama Soumaoro but no penalty was awarded after a VAR review believed the foul occured outside the area. Soumaoro was issued a red card after the review for dissent. In the ensuing protests by Bologna, Gary Medel was also sent off — leaving the visitors with nine men.SoccerMATCHDAY: Chelsea faces Crystal Palace in FA Cup semisEbobisse 2 goals, Earthquakes draw Nashville 2-2Gerard scores in Villarreal 2-1 win at Getafe before injuryLens beats northern rival Lille 2-1, Saint-Etienne also winsVlahović then notched his 22nd goal this season, having joined from Fiorentina in January, and the 50th of his career in Serie A.FLYING FIORENTINAFiorentina edged visiting Venezia 1-0 with a goal from Lucas Torreira to move up to sixth place and a potential spot in Europe.The Viola have won three straight, six of their last eight, and are unbeaten in six consecutive matches.Torreira scored from close range following a free kick after Igor Julio pulled the ball back from the end line.
