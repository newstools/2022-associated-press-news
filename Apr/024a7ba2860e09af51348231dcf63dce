MADRID (AP) — Australian Open finalist Danielle Collins won the last eight games to advance to the second round of the Madrid Open with a 7-5, 6-0 victory over Monica Puig on Friday.Puig, the Olympic gold medalist in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, is returning to action following shoulder and bicep surgeries. The 28-year-old Puerto Rican appeared in only four matches since her first major surgery in 2019.“You never know what to expect when someone’s been out for a while, and they’ve been working on some things,” the sixth-seeded Collins said. “You don’t know what type of game style that they’re going to play, so it was a little bit tricky trying to anticipate what she was going to do. I think she played at a super-high level, especially in the first set, and gave me a lot of challenges, so I really needed to just find my rhythm on the court.”Collins also missed matches this season because of injury, including a neck ailment that she picked up during her quarterfinal run in Miami.ADVERTISEMENT“When you go a little period where you aren’t playing some matches, you almost feel a little bit rusty,” the 28-year-old American said. “I just needed to be patient and try to get myself back into it.”TennisVan de Zandschulp upsets Ruud to reach BMW Open semifinalsCollins beats Puig to reach 2nd round at Madrid OpenBecker gets 2 1/2 years in prison for bankruptcy offensesRuud defeats Molcan to reach BMW Open quarterfinalsAnother American to advance was 12th-seeded Jessica Pegula, who beat Camila Giorgi 7-5, 2-6, 7-5.
