Trinity Rodman, who came in as a second-half substitute, scored her first international goal for the United States. The 2021 U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year is the daughter of former NBA player Dennis Rodman.

Sophia Smith had a hat trick in the victory. An own goal just 25 seconds into the game gave the United States the early lead at Subaru Park, home of Major League Soccer’s Philadelphia Union.

Just 21, Rodman plays professionally for the Washington Spirit of the National Women’s Soccer League. Puce and Sanchez added late goals. Aubrey Kingsbury made her debut for the national team in goal. At 30, she’s the oldest player in team history to earn her first cap. Naomi Girma, the No. 1 pick in the 2022 NWSL draft by the San Diego Wave, also made her debut for the United States. The average caps among the starting lineup was 21, and it was the first time since 2013 that the team didn’t start a player with 100 or more caps. The U.S. team was originally scheduled to play a team from Asia for the international break but that team had to pull out. Coronavirus and World Cup qualifying made finding a new opponent difficult.Two veterans, Becky Sauerbrunn and Megan Rapinoe, were left off the roster for the two games against Uzbekistan because of injury. Julie Ertz recently announced that she was expecting her first child, and Crystal Dunn is also pregnant. Other veterans who weren’t with the team included Alex Morgan, Tobin Heath and Christen Press as coach Vlatko Andonovski continued to emphasize young players in preparation for World Cup qualifying in July. The U.S. team’s unbeaten streak on American soil includes 60 wins and seven draws. ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
