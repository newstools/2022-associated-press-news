MILWAUKEE (AP) — Face masks are again mandatory in Milwaukee Public Schools for students and staff in all the district’s buildings effective Wednesday. MPS officials said in a statement that the decision was made after determining there is a significant transmission of the coronavirus in Milwaukee. “The district has the option to revert back to a mask-optional policy if it is determined that there is not a significant risk of virus transmission within the city of Milwaukee and/or the school district. Masks will continue to be available for students and staff in all district buildings,” the statement read. The mandate follows a school board vote last month to make face coverings optional starting Monday, April 18. The district includes about 69,000 students.
