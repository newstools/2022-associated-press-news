OLATHE, Kan. (AP) — A Kansas nonprofit is sending medical supplies to Ukraine after hearing alarming accounts of a hospital in Kyiv low on treatments and basic tools.The Kansas City Star reports  that Olathe, Kansas-based Global Care Force raised $21,000 to bring resources overseas.Brenda Poor, a spokeswoman for the organization. said the packages were stuffed into seven large suitcases and checked onto a plane to Warsaw, Poland, alongside the non-profit’s director of operations on Tuesday afternoon.The group has multiple plans for transporting the supplies — which include thousands of doses of antibiotics — over the border. “The situation in Ukraine can be dangerous,” said Scott Oberkrom, the group’s president. “We have option A option B and an option C — we’re just crossing our fingers that the first option is what’s going to work.”The organization launched in 2020 as COVID Care Force and garnered a wide network of donors and nearly 1,500 volunteers. In September 2021 it began transitioning to help hospitals overseas under the name of Global Care Force.
