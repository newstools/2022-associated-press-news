NEW YORK (AP) — Vin Scully has won the second Lifetime Achievement Award presented by Baseball Digest.The longtime Dodgers announcer was honored Tuesday with an annual distinction that recognizes a living individual “who has made significant contributions to the national game.”The 94-year-old Scully retired after the 2016 season, ending a 67-year broadcasting career that stretched back to when the Dodgers played in Brooklyn before moving to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. It was easily the longest tenure of any announcer with one team. He was one of six finalists last year, when Willie Mays won the inaugural award. This year, a 17-member panel chose from a list of candidates that included Bobby Cox, Sandy Koufax, Rachel Robinson, Bud Selig and Joe Torre, among others.“Any award that’s already been won by Willie Mays, who certainly was one of my favorite players and one for whom I had great respect, is an honor,” Scully said in a news release. “It’s an honor to even have my name linked with his in some way. I was honored, delighted and surprised that I turned out to be the second winner of Baseball Digest’s Lifetime Achievement Award. I’m proud of it and humble at the same time.” MLBGiants' Nakken 1st MLB female coach on field, SF tops PadresLEADING OFF: Rodríguez vs former team, Nakken makes historyBraves square off against the Nationals in series rubber matchRays bring 1-0 series advantage over Athletics into game 2ADVERTISEMENTScully won the National Baseball Hall of Fame’s Ford C.
