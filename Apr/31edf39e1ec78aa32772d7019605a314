CAVALIER, N.D. (AP) — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is seeking public input on a draft environmental assessment of a proposed cooling pond at a military radar station at Cavalier Space Force Station, in remote northeastern North Dakota.The proposed project at the Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System includes a 23.5 million gallon pond and associated water pipeline, pump station and water quality maintenance system. The project would provide a backup to ensure that enough water is available if the current cooling system fails. The Army Corps says the new cooling pond would also include lines to transfer cool, potable water to the power plant, as well as heated water back to the cooling pond. The construction would involve site earthwork, site development, a cooling distribution system, and an electrical and storm sewer system.The Cavalier Air Force Station, built in the early 1970s to deter the Soviet Union’s nuclear arsenal, began getting improvements several years ago. ADVERTISEMENTThe 10th Space Warning Squadron, a host unit at the base, uses the radar station to monitor and track potential missile launches against North America. The radar station also provides missile warning and space surveillance data to North American Aerospace Defense Command, United States Strategic Command and regional combatant commanders. The Army Corps is encouraging the public to provide comments on the draft environmental assessment within 30 days. The document can be found online for review.
