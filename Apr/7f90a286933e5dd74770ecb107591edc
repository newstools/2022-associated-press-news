BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A small private school in Baton Rouge is closing after 22 years of operation, leaving parents looking for a place to enroll their children for next school year. The Baton Rouge International School blamed a coronavirus pandemic-related drop in enrollment from which it never recovered as a reason for the closing, according to The Advocate. The school offered a full multilingual immersion program in English, Spanish, French and Chinese. It is part of a global network of 50 schools known as the International Schools Partnership.“It is ... with deep and heartfelt sadness that I write to tell you that Baton Rouge International School will permanently close at the end of this school year,” read a letter sent to parents last week. ADVERTISEMENTThe last day of classes is May 26. The closure announcement was made after most other private schools had already enrolled students for next year. “We’re stabbing in the dark hoping we might get on a wait list,” said Dawn DePorter-Kimmence, who has two children at the school. She told the newspaper she’s still hoping a benefactor will save the school.COVID-19Suit seeks to overturn renewed Philadelphia mask mandatePerfect spring weather greets Boston Marathon's April returnWisconsin Democrats aim to beat Sen.
