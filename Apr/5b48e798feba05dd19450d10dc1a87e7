THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Netherlands national soccer team coach Louis van Gaal has revealed that he is being treated for an aggressive form of prostate cancer but still plans to lead the team at the World Cup in Qatar in November.Van Gaal told Sunday night Dutch talk show “Humberto” that players in the team did not know about his diagnosis even though he was receiving night-time treatment during four training camps.“You don’t tell something like this to people you work with because it could influence their choices, their energy or whatever, and I thought, ‘they shouldn’t know,’” he said.He said he has undergone 25 radiation therapy treatments.“I have been to the hospital in the evening or night in every period, without the players knowing,” the 70-year-old coach said.Van Gaal lost his first wife to cancer.“It’s part of life. I have experienced so much with disease and death, in my own family, my wife,” he said. “I have probably been enriched as a person by all those experiences I have had with it.”ADVERTISEMENTVan Gaal is in his third stint as Netherlands coach. He led the team to the semifinals of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He also has coached clubs including Barcelona, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Ajax, leading the Amsterdam club to the Champions League title in 1995.SoccerStyle clash as Guardiola, Simeone meet in Champions LeagueDortmund's full house party spoiled as team problems returnLowry has 16 points, 10 assists as Heat beat Raptors 114-109Chicharito scores twice, Galaxy down Timbers 3-1He did not attend last week’s World Cup draw in Qatar after testing positive for COVID-19.
