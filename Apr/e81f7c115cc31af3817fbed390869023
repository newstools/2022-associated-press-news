Honduras’ Supreme Court rejected his appeal of a judge’s decision favoring extradition.His court appearance Friday in New York was expected to be virtual because of COVID-19 protocols, authorities said.Hernández has denied any wrongdoing. In a video message released Thursday, he said, “I am innocent; I have been and I am being unjustly subjected to prosecution.”
