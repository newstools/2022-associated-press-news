SEATTLE (AP) — Alaska Airlines said Monday that masks will be optional on their flights — after a federal judge voided the national COVID-19-related mask mandate covering airlines and other public transportation. The Seattle-based airline said in a statement that because of the judicial decision, guests and employees would have the option to wear a mask while traveling in the U.S. and at work. “While we are glad this means many of us get to see your smiling faces, we understand some might have mixed feelings,” the statement said. “Please remember to be kind to one another and that wearing a mask while traveling is still an option.”Alaska also said some passengers who were banned for violating the mask policy will remain banned. “Based on our reports, we will have some guests whose behavior was particularly egregious who will remain banned, even after the mask policy is rescinded,” the statement said.
