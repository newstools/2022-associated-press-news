Brown had been very active on social media wanting a new contract, and he was recently caught on video talking with Deebo Samuel, making it clear the Titans weren’t going above $20 million a year.

Brown played a full season only as a rookie.ADVERTISEMENTNFL2022 NFL Draft l First round features 5 Georgia defendersJags take 'athletic freak' Walker with top pick in NFL draftLions take Hutchinson at No. 2, trade up to take WilliamsBreaking down players selected in 1st round of NFL draftThe 6-foot-6, 340-pound Davis has unique athleticism and speed for a massive athlete who can anchor the middle of the defensive line.
