NEW YORK (AP) — A lawyer for New York City was fired after she crashed a news conference Monday to confront Mayor Eric Adams about the city’s mask mandate for children aged 2 to 4.Daniela Jampel, who had worked for the city law department since 2016, was fired later on Monday, a department spokesperson said.Jampel was fired after she attended a City Hall press conference and demanded that Adams “unmask our toddlers.” The law department spokesperson said she had misrepresented herself as a journalist at the press conference.The Democratic mayor announced last Friday that a mask rule for children under 5 in schools and daycare centers would remain in effect because of a rise in COVID-19 cases due to the omicron BA.2 variant of the virus.ADVERTISEMENTJampel has been a vocal advocate for keeping schools open and for ending mask mandates during the coronavirus pandemic.

Until tonight. Fighting to keep masks on toddlers is shameful. I am ashamed of my office.”Jampel posted and deleted another tweet after her firing Monday saying she was retaining counsel. Messages asking for comment were sent to Jampel Tuesday.
