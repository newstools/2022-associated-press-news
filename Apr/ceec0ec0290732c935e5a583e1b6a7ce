LONDON (AP) — Former Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins has revealed that he was sexually groomed by a coach when he was 13 years old.The five-time Olympic champion made the allegation in an interview with Men’s Health UK magazine. He did not identify the coach.“I was groomed by a coach when I was younger — I was about 13 — and I never fully accepted that,” said the 41-year-old Wiggins, who won the Tour in 2012 and retired four years later.Asked if he was groomed sexually, Wiggins said: “Yes. It all impacted me as an adult. ... I buried it,” preferring not to speak out at the time because of a difficult relationship with his stepfather.Wiggins has previously spoken about his childhood, which included his father walking out on the family. His father was Australian cyclist Gary Wiggins, who died in 2008 following a fight at a house party.Wiggins is one of the most decorated British Olympians. He won three individual gold medals and two team golds, the last of which was at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. Wiggins won eight medals overall.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
