To take from these funds is to take from those experiencing legitimate hardship and genuine need.”Pacheco pleaded guilty in August to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.Her husband and a friend have previously been sentenced to prison for their roles in the scheme.
