COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) — Baseball’s Hall of Fame is restructuring its veterans committees for the third time in 12 years.The Hall said Friday it is revamping the panels into the Contemporary Baseball Era from 1980 on and Classic Baseball Era for before 1980. The Contemporary Baseball Era will hold a separate ballot for players and another for managers, executives and umpires.Each ballot will include eight candidates to be considered by 16 voters, down from 10 candidates previously. A vote of at least 75% remains necessary for election. Starting next January, the player ballot will include candidates who have been retired for 16 seasons — one year after exhausting eligibility for the Baseball Writers’ Association of America ballot.Each committee will meet every three years, starting with Contemporary Baseball/Players this December, Contemporary Baseball/Managers-Umpires-Executives in December 2023 and Classic Baseball in December 2024.ADVERTISEMENTIn 2010 the Hall established three committees: Pre-Integration (1871-1946), Golden (1947-72) and Expansion (starting in 1973). That was changed in 2016 to four committees: Golden Days (1950-69), Modern Baseball (1970-87), Today’s Game (1988-2016) and Early Baseball (1871-1949).MLBTigers' Cabrera gets 3,000th hit; 33rd player to reach markThis Date in BaseballFriday's Sports In BriefAstros take 3-game losing streak into matchup with the Blue JaysThe Ford C.
