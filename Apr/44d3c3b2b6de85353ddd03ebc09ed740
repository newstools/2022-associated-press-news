BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — State Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, who was first elected to the Louisiana Legislature in 1999, announced her resignation from the Senate on Friday, saying she needed to focus her energy on recovery from a nearly 30-year struggle with depression and gambling addiction.Peterson, who rose to become Speaker Pro Tempore of the House before her election to the state Senate in 2010, is a former chair of the state Democratic Party. She ran for Congress last year, losing a runoff race to fellow Democrat Troy Carter in a bid to fill the vacancy left when Cedric Richmond. Richmond had joined the White House staff of President Joe Biden. “As I’ve previously shared, I have personally struggled with depression and a gambling addiction for the entirety of my legislative career; in fact, it has been close to 30 years,” Peterson said in her statement. “At this time, I must place all of my energy on my own mental health and personal well-being, and therefore have tendered my resignation effective immediately.”
