LAS VEGAS (AP) — School police in Las Vegas have aired footage from a campus officer’s body-worn camera showing him fire three gunshots at a moving car last week after the vehicle struck a girl amid a report of a fight in a high school parking lot.Clark County School District police Lt. Bryan Zink said Tuesday the car was traveling at 22 mph in the 5 mph parking lot, and the driver made a U-turn and drove toward students and staff — striking the female student — before Officer Christopher Knight fired three shots.Knight was recorded shouting for people to get out of the way before the March 29 shooting in a parking lot at Western High School.Knight and another campus officer assigned to the school had responded to reports of a fight and a vehicle with a possible weapon inside as students were being dismissed for the day.ADVERTISEMENTThe four people in the vehicle were not students, Zink said, and about 300 people typically meet school buses in the parking lot at that time of day.The student hit by the car was treated at a hospital for minor injuries, and Zink said a female passenger in the vehicle was dropped at home before her parent took her to a hospital for treatment of a minor injury.The driver drove himself to another hospital where he was treated for a graze wound to the head. Zink said he was arrested as a juvenile on suspicion of battery with a deadly weapon, possession of a dangerous weapon on school property and disregard for public safety.Zink said Las Vegas police found a gun in the car.The campus just west of downtown has nearly 2,800 students. It is one of more than 70 high schools in the sprawling Las Vegas-based district — the nation’s fifth-largest, with more than 300,000 students.The shooting was the first involving a school district officer since 2005, Zink said.
