NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office has fired and arrested one of its recruits, alleging he brought marijuana into the New Orleans jail to reportedly deliver it to an inmate.Derrick Webb, 20, was arrested Tuesday on three counts each of possession with the intent to distribute marijuana, introducing contraband in prison and malfeasance in office, the sheriff’s office said in a news release.Investigators found two bags of marijuana during a search and “Webb admitted that the packages were intended to be delivered to an inmate in exchange for money received from a civilian,” the sheriff’s office said.Webb also admitted to delivering marijuana to inmates at least two previous times, the sheriff’s office said. “We remain vigilant about keeping contraband out of our facilities and we have zero tolerance for these actions,” Sheriff Marlin Gusman said.
