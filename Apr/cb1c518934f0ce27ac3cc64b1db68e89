LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer sued the woman who accused him of sexual assault in federal court Monday, in a move that came less than three months after prosecutors decided not to file criminal charges against the athlete.The San Diego woman, whom the pitcher had met through social media, had alleged that Bauer beat and sexually abused her last year. She later sought — but was denied — a restraining order against him. Los Angeles prosecutors said in February there was insufficient evidence to prove the woman’s accusations beyond a reasonable doubt.Bauer named the woman and one of her attorneys, Niranjan Fred Thiagarajah, as defendants in the suit. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault.“She wanted to destroy Mr. Bauer’s reputation and baseball career, garner attention for herself, and extract millions of dollars from Mr. Bauer,” the lawsuit states.ADVERTISEMENTThiagarajah and Marc Garelick, another attorney who represents the woman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.Bauer was placed on administrative leave last July 2 under the joint domestic violence and sexual assault policy of Major League Baseball and the players’ association. The leave has been repeatedly extended and currently expires Friday.
