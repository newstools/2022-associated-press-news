PUNE, India (AP) — Fast bowlers Mohsin Khan and Dushmantha Chameera carried Lucknow Super Giants to a 20-run win over Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League on Friday.Playing its first game at Pune, Lucknow’s batters struggled against the pace of Kagiso Rabada (4-38) before reaching 153-8.Punjab petered out at 133-8.Left-armer Khan, playing his third IPL game, picked up 3-24 and Sri Lanka pacer Chameera grabbed the all-important wickets of Mayank Agarwal on 25 and top scorer Jonny Bairstow on 32.“We had batsmen who were set but we kept getting out,” Agarwal said. “We need to face the truth that we didn’t bat well. It should have been chased down but we were below par with the bat.”Lucknow was third on the table with six wins in nine games, while Punjab was seventh with four wins.Punjab seemed to have the chase in control at 88-3 after 12 overs but Khan got Liam Livingstone to edge behind on 18 and the opposition derailed.ADVERTISEMENTBairstow used his feet well against the spinners but was caught at third man off Chameera in the 16th over.Earlier, after Lucknow was put in to bat, Quinton de Kock (46) and Deepak Hooda (34) combined in an 85-run second-wicket stand before Punjab turned the pressure back on them through Rabada.CricketStokes chosen as England test captain; Broad, Anderson backCricket star's charges dismissed on mental health groundsFormer South Africa cricket captain Smith cleared of racism Windies captain Pollard retires from international cricketDe Kock got a feather edge off fast bowler Sandeep Sharma and walked off after being adjudged not out by the on-field umpire, but Lucknow went for a successful video referral.Hooda was run out off a sharp direct throw from Bairstow in the deep at the non-striker’s end, and Rabada claimed three quick wickets in his return spell.
