SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — Former Syracuse star Sue Ludwig will be an assistant on the Orange women’s basketball team, which is headed by former teammate Felisha Legette-Jack. Legette-Jack was named the coach at Syracuse about two weeks ago. “I am thrilled to add Sue Ludwig to our staff here,” Legette-Jack said in a statement. “She has a strong mind for the offensive side of the ball, and she is known for developing her guards’ IQ for the game.”Ludwig and Legette-Jack helped lead the Orange to their first Big East championship and first NCAA Tournament appearance in program history in 1984 as freshmen. Ludwig is a two-time All-Big East selection at point guard, and has spent the past 31 years as the varsity girls’ basketball coach at Westhill High School in Syracuse, where she posted a 585-116 record. Legette-Jack is revamping the staff completely after the Orange finished 11-18 overall and 4-14 in the Atlantic Coast Conference this past season under interim coach Vonn Read and missed the NCAA Tournament for the first time in a decade. Ludwig is her first hire.ADVERTISEMENTRead had been an associate head coach since 2013 and took over a program that was pretty much stripped bare after 11 players transferred following the 2020-21 season and longtime coach Quentin Hillsman resigned during an investigation into his coaching practices.
