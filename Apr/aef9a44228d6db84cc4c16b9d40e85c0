MUMBAI, India (AP) — Virus-hit Delhi Capitals put up a splendid performance with both the ball and the bat to beat Punjab Kings by nine wickets in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday.The organizers had to move Delhi’s match from Pune to Mumbai after several members of the team tested positive for COVID-19, including Australian allrounder Mitchell Marsh.But Delhi spinners Axar Patel, Lalit Yadav and Kuldeep Yadav shrugged off the absences by sharing six wickets between them to bowl out Punjab for 115.David Warner then smashed his 53rd IPL half century -- his third in the last four innings -- as the left-hander stayed unbeaten on 60 off just 30 balls and carried Delhi to 119 in just 10.3 overs.“The bowlers did a fantastic job to make ours easier,” Warner said. “We had to go big in the powerplay, credit to our bowlers to getting them out. I was just trying to be positive and am happy to have played with Shaw.”ADVERTISEMENTWarner shared a blistering 83-run first wicket stand with Prithvi Shaw (41) as they raised Delhi’s best ever score of 81 runs in the batting powerplay during the IPL.Shaw swept hard at Rahul Chahar soon after the batting powerplay ended and was caught at deep midwicket before Warner sealed the comprehensive win for Delhi with his 11th boundary.CricketWindies captain Pollard retires from international cricketRob Key appointed as new head of England men's cricketRoot quits as England test cricket captain after 5 yearsAndrew McDonald named head coach of Australian cricket teamAfter being put in to bat, Punjab started off confidently as they raced to 27-0 inside the first three overs. However, Delhi struck four times in the next fours overs as Punjab slipped to 54-4.Captain Mayank Agarwal chopped on Mutafizur Rahman back onto his stumps after scoring 24, Shikhar Dhawan was caught behind and Liam Livingstone lasted only three balls before Patel had the Englishman stumped.Jonny Bairstow (9) started well by hitting two boundaries but then pulled Khaleel Ahmed’s short pitched delivery to deep fine leg where Mustafizur took a neat catch.Kuldeep and Lalit then ran through the tail quickly as Punjab lost its last five wickets for 25 runs with No. 10 batter Arshdeep Singh getting run out off the last ball of final over.Delhi’s brisk chase lifted it to sixth place in the points table with six points from six games while Punjab, which has played seven matches and has also won three games, slipped to No. 8.“We did not bat or bowl well and we have to put this behind,” Agarwal said of Punjab’s heavy loss. “Losing too many wickets too early, but I do not want to dig too deep as the more we do it, the more the negatives that will come.”___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
