BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Gerard Moreno scored one goal and set up another before the Villarreal striker was substituted because of injury during his team’s 2-1 win at Getafe in the Spanish league on Saturday.Despite struggling with injuries this season, Gerard has been a key player in Villarreal’s impressive run to the Champions League semifinals after ousting Juventus and, this week, Bayern Munich in the knockout rounds.Gerard gave Villarreal the lead in the seventh minute and helped to make it 2-0 in the 16th when he stole the ball in midfield to start a counterattack. The Spain striker, who also set up Samuel Chukwueze’s late winner to topple Bayern on Tuesday, again made the key pass by playing Manuel Trigueros clear to beat David Soria.Gerard had to be substituted in the 61st after he was attended by team doctors. He touched the back of his right thigh before walking off gingerly.ADVERTISEMENTEmery said Gerard had a muscular injury but team doctors had yet to determine how long he would be out, leaving in question his availability for the European semifinals against Liverpool in two weeks.SoccerSteffen's blunder gifts Liverpool cup semifinal goal vs CityDynamo and Timbers finish in 0-0 tieAtlanta United, Cincinnati tie 0-0MATCHDAY: Chelsea faces Crystal Palace in FA Cup semis“He has not been unlucky with injuries this season.
