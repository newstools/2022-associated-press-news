But the real drama was elsewhere.Hertha Berlin thought it had survival secured until it conceded in injury time to draw at Arminia Bielefeld 1-1 while Stuttgart also scored late to keep the relegation scrap going into the final two games.Hertha substitutes Luca Wollschläger and Maximilian Mittelstädt should have scored their team’s second goal to secure the win when they had only the goalkeeper to beat in the 88th minute, and Hertha was to rue their gaping miss when Joakim Nilsson equalized for Bielefeld.Chris Führich scored in the 89th for Stuttgart to draw against visiting Wolfsburg 1-1.Former Hertha defender John Brooks struck a blow for his old team when he scored in the 13th for Wolfsburg.But the late goals mean Hertha, Stuttgart and Bielefeld can all still be relegated, while Augsburg is also not yet safe after losing at home to Cologne 4-1.ADVERTISEMENTBielefeld remained second last on 27 points, Stuttgart was in the relegation playoff spot with 29, Hertha was on 33 and Augsburg 35 with two rounds remaining.SoccerBarcelona reaches Women's CL final despite loss With Liga title, Marcelo is most successful Madrid playerAncelotti first coach to win title in Europe's top 5 leaguesMadrid clinches record-extending 35th Spanish league titleBAYERN’S HANGOVERBayern, which clinched the league title last weekend, lost 3-1 in Mainz, where the home team also struck the goal-frame four times in a dominant performance.Mainz had 22 attempts at goal in contrast to Bayern’s seven.
