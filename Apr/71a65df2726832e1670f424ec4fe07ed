COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — A leading human rights group is demanding the Sri Lankan authorities conduct a prompt and impartial probe into a police shooting  that left one person dead and 13 others injured during protests over fuel price hike amid the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.The New York-based Human Rights Watch urged the authorities to probe the “apparent use of excessive force by police” in the incident and “take appropriate steps against any wrongdoing.”Patricia Grossman, the group’s associate Asia director, said “the use of live ammunition” by police against demonstrators “appears to be a flagrant misuse of lethal force.”“People protesting government policies that affect their lives and livelihoods shouldn’t have to fear for their lives,” she said in a statement released late Wednesday night, adding, “International law prohibits the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers unless there is an imminent threat to life.” ADVERTISEMENTThe group said Sri Lanka has a long history of failing to provide justice and redress to victims of human rights violations.BusinessAs shares plunge, Netflix takes aim at password sharing, adsEXPLAINER: What's the impact if Europe cuts off Russian oil?Fewest Americans collecting jobless aid since 1970American Airlines loses $1.6 billion but sees better outlookThe statement comes hours after Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa pledged an impartial and transparent inquiry into the shooting which was the first by security forces during weeks of protests and reignited widespread demonstrations across the Indian Ocean island nation. The shooting occurred in Rambukkana, 90 kilometers (55 miles) northeast of the capital, Colombo.Public Security Minister Prasanna Ranatunga said Wednesday that police had been patient but needed to use minimal force to stop the protests from escalating into major violence. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa responded by asking Parliament, “Does killing a protester mean the use of minimal force?”“What this murderous and terrorist government does today is the suppression of the people,” he added.Fifteen police officers were treated at a hospital for minor injuries after clashes with the protesters on Tuesday. Police said the demonstrators in Rambukkana blocked railway tracks and roads and ignored police warnings to disperse. Police also said protesters threw rocks at them.The calls for investigations came as Parliament on Thursday observed a minute’s silence in memory of the more than 260 people killed in the 2019 Islamic State-inspired suicide bomb attacks on churches and tourist hotels.ADVERTISEMENTArchbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, at a multi-religious memorial service in Colombo, reiterated his objection to what he called the government’s lack of interest in uncovering those whose alleged inaction led to the attacks.Ranjith had earlier called on authorities to investigate possible links with the attackers and some members of the state’s intelligence service after reports that they knew at least one of the attackers and had met with him.Protesters occupying the entrance to the president’s office for a 13th day demanding the president’s resignation over the economic crisis offered alms to Buddhist and Christian clergy in memory of the dead.
