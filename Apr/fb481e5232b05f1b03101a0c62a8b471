LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) — The trial of a former Leavenworth police officer charged in a fatal shooting in 2017 ended in a mistrial after jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict. Matthew Harrington was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of 47-year-old Antonio Garcia Jr., who was shot by Harrington as he sat in his vehicle in Leavenworth. The mistrial was declared on Wednesday. A court hearing was scheduled for May 7 to determine if Harrington will face a second trial, KSHB-TV reported. The shooting occurred when Harrington responded to a domestic dispute at a Leavenworth home on July 11, 2017. Garcia left but later returned and was sitting in his vehicle when Harrington approached.Prosecutors said Garcia had a knife but didn’t threaten Harrington, who fired several times into the vehicle after the two men struggled, according to video from Harrington’s body camera.
