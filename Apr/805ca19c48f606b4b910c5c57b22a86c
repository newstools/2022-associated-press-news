MIAMI (AP) — The NBA fined two Miami Heat players and the team itself a total of $55,000 on Thursday, over two incidents in the team’s series-clinching win earlier this week against the Atlanta Hawks.Markieff Morris was fined $25,000 for interfering with live game play while on the bench. Jimmy Butler was fined $15,000 for making what the league determined to be an obscene gesture, and the team was fined an additional $15,000 for turning a video of the gesture into a social media post.All three fines were announced Thursday.Morris was not in the game when he grabbed and then held Hawks guard De’Andre Hunter out of bounds during third-quarter play. Hunter had stepped into the Heat bench area and Morris’ act kept him from getting back inbounds while the play was ongoing.Morris was assessed a technical at the time as well.Butler did not play in Tuesday’s 97-94 victory, watching the game from the bench because of knee soreness. He made the gesture a few seconds after Max Strus connected on a second consecutive 3-pointer, part of a 10-0 run by Strus and a 17-0 run by the Heat that put them ahead in the game for good.ADVERTISEMENTNBACarey, Holloway become latest Georgetown players to transferT-wolves try to avoid 'hero' ball, stay alive vs. GrizzliesNuggets eye deep playoff run next season with healthy teamSuns star Devin Booker returns for Game 6 against PelicansThe social media post has since been deleted from the team account.It is Butler’s third known fine this season, totaling $70,000.
