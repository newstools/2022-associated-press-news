LONDON (AP) — England will travel to Australia for a three-test rugby series in July, with Sydney Cricket Ground hosting the final match for its first international since 1986.England last toured Australia in 2016, sweeping the three-test series in Eddie Jones’s first year as coach to start an eight-match winning run against the Wallabies.The 2022 tour schedule was announced Tuesday, with the teams playing in Perth on July 2, in Brisbane on July 9, and at the SCG on July 16. That marks the return of international rugby to Sydney for the first time since 2020 because of the pandemic.Jones will return to his native Australia under pressure after another disappointing Six Nations, when England lost three of its five games for the second straight year.“The Australia tour is a great opportunity for growth for this team and a good challenge at the end of the season,” Jones said. “It will be the first time many of the younger players have toured abroad with England and it will be vital practice and experience ahead of the World Cup.”___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
