SEATTLE (AP) — Officials with Washington State Ferries acknowledge the system is short on staff and in need of dozens of new recruits. A March report from the ferry system says staff shortages are unprecedented in the system’s 70-year history, KING-TV reported. “It’s not good, quite honestly. We don’t have enough people to sail the vessels right now,” Washington State Ferry spokesman Ian Sterling said Monday. “We need to hire, train, and get people out on the water.” Delays and cancellations have been typical during the pandemic. Sterling said a staffing shortage had been expected even before the pandemic began.The Washington State Ferry system is competing with for-profit companies, particularly for engine room crews, but the system has hired “well over a hundred people in the last six months,” he said.
